<h2><a name="TRANSLATORS_NOTE" id="TRANSLATORS_NOTE"></a>TRANSLATOR'S NOTE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> brightly written little book by the well-known
French author, Edmund Plauchut, who has
spent many years in China, is the first of the new
series known as the "Livres d'or de la Science"
recently commenced by MM. Schleicher Frères
of Paris. It gives in a succinct form a very complete
account of the Chinese, both past and present,
their religion, their literature, and their time-honoured
customs. Touching but lightly on the
many vexed questions of modern diplomacy, it
yet presents a very true picture of the problems
European statesmen have to solve in connection
with the inevitable partition of the Celestial Empire,
and will, it is hoped, be found of real service to
those who wish to be abreast with the times, yet
who have not the leisure to read the longer and
more exhaustive books on the subject which are
continually appearing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I do</span> not deny the happiness of a life spent
beneath the shadow of the belfry of one's native
place, in all the unruffled peace of one's own home,
surrounded by one's own family; but, after all, what
are such joys as these compared to those of the
explorer who goes forth to meet the unknown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
ready for all that may betide, making fresh discoveries
at every turn, gladly facing all dangers
and rejoicing in the ever-changing, ever-widening
horizon before him? Who would care to forego the
joys of memory, the power of living over again in
old age the adventures of youth, of seeing once
more with the mind's eye the wonders of the far-distant
lands visited when the mind was still
buoyant, the sight still undimmed, the limbs still
in all the vigour of manhood? Happy mortal
indeed is he who, thoroughly imbued with the
spirit of the discoverer, looks upon death itself not
as the end of all things, but the threshold of a new
world, the beginning of yet another journey fraught
with the deepest interest, to a bourne all the more
fascinating because of the deep mystery in which it
is shrouded.</p>

<p>This was how I reasoned with myself when I
was a mere lad eagerly devouring the accounts of
the work of the great early explorers, Marco Polo,
the Dupleix, La PÃ©rouse, Bougainville, Dumont
D'Urville, Christopher Columbus, Mungo Park,
the Landers, etc., not to speak of Swift's fascinating
romance <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>, and the yet more
thrilling <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> of Defoe. Like all boys
with vivid imaginations, I was fired with a longing
to emulate all these heroes, and said to my mother:
"I have made up my mind to be a sailor!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>My ardour was, however, quickly quenched when
I saw my mother's beautiful eyes fill with tears
at the thought of parting from me. This did not
prevent me from leaving France a few years later,
for I found myself whilst still quite a young man
free to go whither I would, and I made up my
mind to make many a long and interesting journey.
Of course I expected to meet with dangers and
misfortunes, but I felt sure that any such drawbacks
would be more than counterbalanced by
the grand sights it would be my privilege to witness.
My anticipations were in every way fully realized,
and if after wandering all over the world I refrain
from saying with Terence: "I am a man, and
nothing in the nature of man is strange to me;"
it is merely because poets alone are privileged to
speak with such egotistical assurance.</p>

<p>I had already spent a considerable time in
Oceania and a few months in Egypt, when I
landed at Hong-Kong on the very threshold of
the ancient Chinese Empire, which, according to
well-authenticated annals, is older even than the
mighty and venerable Egypt of the Pharaohs. I
went to China as much to study her past on the
spot as to be one of the first to hail that transformation
which, when I arrived, was already on
the eve of its inauguration, and is now rapidly
becoming an accomplished fact. There was, indeed,
urgent need for haste if I wished to study that
moribund China so long closed to Europeans
before the great change came, and cared to gaze
upon her far-stretching table-lands girt about by
heights crowned with never-melting snow, ere their
solitudes were broken in upon by the desecrating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
steam-engine, in districts whence in mediÃ¦val times
great hordes of yellow-skinned, fierce-eyed barbarians,
their long black hair floating on their
shoulders, swept westward to devastate Europe.</p>

<p>In those days five hundred thousand Tartars
invaded Russia, took possession of Moscow, burnt
Cracow, and penetrated as far as Hungary. Saint
Louis of France, who was then on the throne, stood
in the greatest dread of them, but this did not
prevent him from making a joke about them,
quoted by the Sieur de Joinville, which, considering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the state of affairs at the time, speaks well for his
pluck and sense of humour. "Mother," he said
to Queen Blanche of Castille, "if these Tartars
come here, we must make them go back to the
Tartarus from which they come!"</p>

<p>Time, however, never fails to bring about the
poetic justice of revenge. Six centuries after the
sack of Cracow a little Anglo-French force entered
Pekin with drums beating and flags flying, pillaged
the Imperial Palaces, and returned to Europe laden
with rich spoil. Chinese, Tartars, Mongols, and
Manchus had all alike allowed themselves to be
beaten by a mere handful of resolute men. What
had they to oppose to European tactics, European
weapons, and above all European discipline? Bows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and arrows, old-fashioned muskets, spears, and
shields adorned with fantastic; designs. There,
was nothing for them to do but to run away; not
that they were cowards, for they never have any
fear of death, but simply because resistance
was hopeless. Most of the generals
in command of the army followed the
usual custom in cases of defeat, and
voluntarily emptied the bowl of poisoned
opium to save themselves from being
triumphed over by their enemies. At Pekin, Canton,
and many other centres of population in the vast
Empire, the terrified women flung themselves into
the wells to escape the violent death they expected
the "red devils" would otherwise have inflicted on
them. Only some forty years ago what did that
immense multitude of Asiatic men and women
know about us Europeans? Just about as much
and no more than we did of them. One thing
only is certain, that in the heroic days of the
founders of the dynasty, from Hwang-Ti, the yellow
Emperor, to Khiang-Luanh, the poet sovereign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
more than one ruler of China had drunk from the
cup of immortality, that is to say, the cup of
poison, rather than live to see the enemy enter
his palaces as a conqueror. Enervated by a long
course of self-indulgence, the Sons of Heaven, as
the Emperors of China proudly style themselves,
have degenerated terribly, and what with their own
weakness and the arrogant
encroachments
of the eunuchs who
guard the Imperial
harem, many of the
sovereigns would have
been deposed, but for
the intervention, now
of an Empress-Dowager,
now of some
favourite wife, who,
seizing the reins of
power, has wielded
the sceptre with virile
strength and skill.</p>

<p>In 1851, when the English took possession of
the island of Hong-Kong, it was but a rugged
conical-shaped rock, dreary and forbidding in
appearance. The Chinese then living on it were
enraged at the intrusion of the foreigners, and one
of them, the only baker on the island, resolved to
dispose of all the intruders at one blow. He
decided to poison them, and with this end in view
he put arsenic into all the bread he supplied to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the foreigners. He over-reached himself, for the
dose was too strong, and suspicion was at once
aroused. Those who tasted the bread escaped with
violent sickness, and the English were not going
to abandon the place for a reason so insignificant
as that.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">FIG. 6.&mdash;A CHINESE COURTESAN.</div>
</div>

<p>Hong-Kong is now a maritime
port of the first rank, and
its harbour is one of the finest
and most beautiful in the whole
world. The town boasts of
hotels managed on the European
system, and the slopes of
the rocks are covered from
the sea-shore to the highest
point of the island with tasty
villas. It is to opium, that
other poison responsible for the
death of so many Celestials,
and as potent in its effects as
the arsenic with which the
patriotic baker tried to kill off
all the foreigners, that Hong-Kong owes its immense
prosperity. The French did much to aid the
English in inaugurating that prosperity in 1857 and
1858, when they joined them as allies in the brief
campaign which resulted in the taking of Canton
and the signing of the celebrated Treaty of Tien-tsin.
The various stipulations of that treaty, the
full significance of which the Chinese do not seem
to have realized at the time, included the right to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the allies of appointing diplomatic agents to the
Court of Pekin, and the opening of five fresh ports
to European commerce, whilst a strip of territory
on the mainland, opposite to the island of Hong-Kong,
was ceded to the British colony. The
benefits which accrued to France were small, but
the increase of British trade was enormous, and
from that time to this the grand harbour has been:
one of the chief naval stations of the East.</p>

<p>In spite of its prosperity and importance, however,
the town is anything but a pleasant place to stop
in, and the foreign visitor soon gets tired of being
jostled about by busy coolies and tipsy sailors.
The great delight of the latter is to get drunk in
the brandy-stores of Victoria Street, and then to
dance, not, strange to say, with women, but without
partners, to the music of a violin and a big drum.
In the evening the floating and resident population
alike resort in crowds to the opium-dens and
houses of ill fame in the upper portions of the
town. No one seems to feel any shame at being
seen to enter these places, the windows of which
are wide open, so that all can look into the brightly
illuminated rooms, whence proceeds the sound of
oaths in all manner of languages, whilst the loud
clash of gongs mingles with the muffled songs of
the Chinese beauties, and every now and then a
shower of crackers is flung into the street below,
bursting into zigzags of fire on the heads of the
startled passers-by. In the eyes of the masters
of the island, the intense commercial activity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of the day atones for the dissipations of the
night.</p>

<p>Contact with Europeans has, however, done little
if anything to modify the ideas and customs of the
Chinese. A few of the great native merchants, it
is true, are willing now and then to drink a glass of
champagne with the representatives of foreign
houses, and teach them
the game of Morra, which,
strange to say, is to all
intents and purposes the
same as that played all
over Italy, and is so well
described by Mrs. Eaton
in her <i>Rome in the Nineteenth
Century</i>. "Morra,"
she says, "is played by
the men, and merely consists
in holding up in
rapid succession any number
of fingers they please,
calling out at the same
time the number their
antagonist shows....
Morra seems to differ in
no respect from the <i>Micure Digitis</i> of the Ancient
Romans." If it be a fact, as some assert, that the
various races of the world are more truly themselves
in their games than in their work, this similarity
in a pastime played by people so different
as the Chinese and the Italians, would have a deep
psychological significance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>However that may be, drinking champagne and
playing Morra together do not lead to any real
friendship or intimacy between the Celestials and
their hated foreign guests. There is not, and it
seems as if there never could be, any true <i>rapprochement</i>,
and this fact is at the root of the anxiety of
statesmen for the future, in spite of the apparent
progress made in the introduction of European
ideas into the very stronghold of Chinese fanaticism,
the Palace of Pekin, where a few months ago, on
the occasion of her birthday, the Dowager Empress
held that first reception of European ladies which
was hailed by the European press as the commencement
of a new era for China. An account
of this historic tea-party may well be added here,
for its being given was truly among the most
remarkable events which have taken place in the
century now so near its close. It seems that
Lady Macdonald, the wife of the British Minister,
was the prime mover in bringing about this
startling innovation in the customs of the most conservative
of all modern nations. The fact that
it was the guests themselves who compelled the
hostess to invite them, detracted not at all from
the cordiality of their reception. Received at
the entrance to the precincts of the Palace by
numerous mandarins in brilliant costumes, the
visitors were carried on State chairs to the electric
tramway, strange anomaly in such a stronghold
of retrogression as the capital of the Celestial
Empire, and thence escorted to the audience-chamber
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
by a group of ladies of the Court specially
selected to attend them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A STRANGE TEA-PARTY</div>

<p>In the throne-room, the Empress and her unfortunate
son, the nominal ruler of China, were
seated side by side on a raised dais, behind a table
decorated with apples and chrysanthemums in the
simple but effective Chinese manner. Presents and
compliments were exchanged, a grand luncheon
was served, over which the Princess Ching presided,
and when tea was handed round later the Dowager
Empress again appeared and sipped a little of the
national beverage from the cup of each minister's
wife. Finally, when the time for leave-taking came,
the astute Dowager, giving way to an apparently
uncontrollable burst of emotion, embraced all her
visitors in turn. Time alone can prove whether
this kiss were indeed one of peace or of future
betrayal. In the eyes of the Court officials and
their ladies it must have appeared far more startling
than any of the political changes with which the
air is rife.</p>

<p>The Chinese people, who know next to nothing
of what is going on, and are more ignorant of the
transformation taking place than even illiterate
Europeans, are as indifferent to the past as to the
future; they have been accustomed for centuries to
obey unchanging laws of a wisdom acknowledged
by even hostile critics; and startling innovation
touching their own lives is the one thing which
moves them out of their constitutional apathy.</p>

<p>Agriculture is the favourite occupation of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Chinese, and they consider the tilling of the ground
almost a religious duty. It has been customary
for many ages for the supreme ruler to turn over
a few furrows at the beginning of the agricultural
year, that is to say the spring, and in all the
provinces of the vast empire a similar ceremony
is performed by the delegate of the Emperor.
Flowers are everywhere cultivated, though generally
in pots, with an enthusiasm amounting to
passion, and marvellous skill is shown in the growing
of dwarf trees, which produce quantities of
fruit. In a word, vegetation in China is stamped
with an originality setting it apart from that of
any other country. In irrigation and the use of
manure Chinese gardeners were long far in advance
of western nations.</p>

<p>The chief ambition of every native of China is
to leave behind him sons who on his death will
give to his memory the homage he himself
rendered to that of his own father, for it is in the
reverence in which ancestors are held that the
Chinese concentrate all their religious feeling.
Even Shang-Ti, or the God of Heaven, Buddha,
Lao-tsze, and Confucius only take secondary rank
as compared with these ancestors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHINESE LITERATI</div>

<p>The Literati, or scholars of China, have won
their much-coveted distinction by many very
severe examinations in the so-called King, or the
five sacred books, and in the works of the great
philosophers. Armed with the diploma securing
to him the rank of a scholar, its fortunate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
possessor may aspire to the very highest functions of
the empire. So very many win that diploma, however,
and the numbers increase so rapidly every
year, that, as in France and in England, there are
not enough appointments for those qualified to
receive them. In spite of this, the scholar even
when out of place commands the respect of all
who have not been promoted to the grade he has
won. In his interesting account of his travels in
Asia, Marcel Monnier gives
a very pregnant illustration
of the state of things
I have been describing.</p>

<p>"As I was leaving the
rampart," he says, "I
witnessed a curious scene
illustrative of the esteem
in which&mdash;in this land
where an hereditary aristocracy
does not exist&mdash;is
held the one ennobling
rank, that of being the owner of a paper diploma.
My bearers had just entered a very narrow causeway
between two rice-fields, when they were suddenly
brought to a halt by another chair coming
from the opposite direction. This chair was occupied
by a young man in elegant attire, wearing
spectacles, and with a general air about him of
being pleased with himself. Apparently he was
a scholar fresh from examinations. The bearers
on each side parleyed together, but neither seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
disposed to yield place to the others. The discussion
seemed likely to be interminable, when the
scholar intervened, and addressing the chief of my
bearers, shouted haughtily to him:</p>

<p>"'Why don't you get out of the way of a
licentiate of Kan-Su?'</p>

<p>"My chief porter, a big sturdy fellow of about
forty, did not move, but without budging an inch
replied with equal haughtiness:</p>

<p>"'A licentiate? And of what year, pray?'</p>

<p>"Then without giving the other time to answer,
he quickly dived into the little leather-bag hanging
from his waist-band, brought out a greasy paper,
and proudly unfolded it as if it were a flag, before
the eyes of his astonished questioner.</p>

<p>"'Look!' he said.</p>

<p>"The young man took the paper with the very
tips of his fingers, but he had scarcely glanced at
the magic inscription on it before he handed it
back with a respectful inclination of the head, at
the same time ordering his men to withdraw. My
porter, too, had his diploma, and he had had it for
a long time. That of recent date had to give way
to the earlier one. My chair passed on in triumph,
whilst that of the newly-created scholar humbly
waited at the side of the road in the rice-field."</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHINESE HONESTY</div>

<p>The Chinese have the trading instinct as fully
developed as have the descendants of Shem.
They carry on commerce with the same wonderful
<i>finesse</i>, the same keen eye for a bargain, and
they are as fond of money as the Jews themselves.
At the same time in really important affairs they
are as much to be trusted, as thoroughly loyal to
the other side, as any great merchant of the City
of London, or the <i>Rue du Sentier</i> in the French
capital. These Chinese traders gave credit for
enormous sums to the first foreign firms which had
the audacity to found the Canton factories. On
the faith of their signatures alone guaranteeing
eventual payment, the heads of these foreign firms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
found themselves trusted with whole cargoes of
tea and silks. After the failure of the Union Bank,
of the <i>Comptoir national d'Escompte</i>, and certain
great American houses, this giving of credit was
discontinued, but that it was ever granted remains
a most significant fact. One proof of the extreme
caution which succeeded the extraordinary confidence
is, that there are no branches of the great
Chinese firms of Shanghai and Hong-Kong in
Paris, Marseilles, or Lyons. This is really no great
loss, for the West will be invaded all too soon by
the yellow races.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BONZES AND BONZESSES</div>

<p>In Asia there are many more mystic dreamers
and poets than is generally supposed. A Chinese
mystic is called a bonze, or talapoin, the former word
being of Japanese origin, introduced to China by
Europeans. Women who devote themselves to a
religious life are called bonzesses, but as certain
abuses crept in of a kind which can readily be
imagined, a very wise law was passed some time
ago forbidding any woman to become a priestess
till after her fortieth year, and certain censors
have long advocated a yet further higher limit
of age.</p>

<p>Amongst young women of the higher classes in
the remote East, especially amongst those whose
beauty destines them for the harem, poetry is held
in high esteem. On the richly-lacquered screens
and on the delicately-coloured fans so popular in
China, are many representations of frail Chinese
or Japanese beauties, tracing certain letters of
the Mandarin alphabet with a fine pencil held in
their tapering fingers with the characteristic pink
nails. The words formed by these letters make
up poetic phrases imbued with all the freshness
and grace of the fair young girls who transcribe
them. In them are sung the praises of the
flowers of the hawthorn, the peach-tree, the sweet-briar,
and even of a certain savoury tea. More than
one Chinese Emperor has done homage to the
Muses, and the most celebrated of these crowned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
poets was Khian-Lung, of the Tartar Manchu
dynasty, who died at the end of the eighteenth
century, and to whom Voltaire addressed the
celebrated letter in verse of which the royal recipient
was probably only able to understand, and that
with considerable difficulty, the last few lines of
which are quoted here:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Receive, Celestial King, the compliments I write<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To one whose mighty throne stands on a double height!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The western world knows well, in spite of all my crimes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have a deep regard for monarchs who make rhymes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O thou whose soul is lit by Art's poetic fires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I pray thee tell me if your prosody requires<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That you in far Pekin, like us, must e'en submit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bind your thoughts in rules to make the tenses fit?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, if you choose to take the Alexandrine beat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two equal lines must walk on six plain, equal feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so, one half for rhyme, the other for the sense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whole of one great work to half you may condense!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The fame of two other Chinese poets, who
flourished in the eighth century of our era, has
also come down to us. These were Tchu-Fu and
Li-Tai-PÃ©, who, as was Malherbe in France, were
the first to reform poetry in their native land,
laying down certain rules, which are still observed
in the present day.</p>

<p>The peace enjoyed for so long a period by the
country under consideration has led to the profession
of arms being held of small account. Until
quite recently all the "warriors" had to do was to
put down local revolts, or to win for themselves a
good drubbing from some aggrieved foreigner.</p>

</div>

<p>The weakness and defective organization of
Asiatic armies is well known, and is proved afresh
at every contact with a European force. The
thorough inefficiency of that of China was forcibly
brought out in the recent war with Japan, when the
latter country
showed itself
to be so far
in advance of
its antagonist
in every way.
Nothing but
drilling by
European officers,
for at
least half a
century, could
make Chinese
soldiers at all
formidable to
white troops.
It is just the
same with the
people of the
Corea, Annam,
Tonquin, and Siam. It will, of course, be urged:
but look at the Japanese, they too belong to the
despised yellow races, yet have they not proved
themselves able to organize a campaign? are they
not full of warlike energy and martial ability?
do they not also take high rank as imaginative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
artists? In what do the white races excel? To
all these queries we reply, the assumption that
the Japanese belong to the same race as the
yellow natives of the continent of Asia has to be
proved. The children of the land of chrysanthemums
and of the rising sun indignantly repel this
hypothesis, and such authorities on ethnology as
K&#339;mpfer, Golownin, Klaproth, and Siebold also
reject it. Moreover, in this world everything is
relative, and because the Japanese troops, armed
with weapons of precision, were able to beat the
badly-equipped Chinese forces, it does not follow
that they could do the same if pitted against
European soldiers. Whether they could or not still
remains to be proved.</p>

<p>Before penetrating into the interior of the
country, and studying the actual customs of the
inhabitants at the present day, it will be well to
glance back to the remote times when China first
became a nation. Very interesting details of those
early days have been preserved in the traditions of
the Celestials, and from them we gather that the
first dwellers in the land lived, as did so many
of the races of Europe, in the forests, or in caves,
clothing themselves in the skins of the wild beasts
slain in the chase, whose flesh supplied them with
food.</p>

<p>The first efforts at civilization appear to have
been made in the North-west of the vast country,
amongst the tribes camped on the banks of the
Hoang-Ho, or Yellow River. The chiefs of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
tribes gradually contracted the habit of making
regular marriages, and living a home life with their
families. To protect their wives and children they
built huts; they discovered how to make fire, and
with its aid to fashion agricultural implements and
weapons. They knew how to distinguish plants
good for food from those dangerous to human life;
they fixed precise dates for the commencement of
each of the four seasons; invented various systems of
calligraphy, finally adopting the one still in use; and
they acquired the art of weaving silk and cotton,
which, according to the eminent sinologist, Leblois
of Strasburg, recently deceased, they learnt from
watching spiders at work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THSIN-CHI-HWANG-TI</div>

<p>Until the third century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> China was divided
into small states, the weaker tributary to the
stronger, the latter independent. The too-celebrated
Emperor Thsin-Chi-Hwang-Ti, who two
hundred years before the Christian era ordered the
destruction by fire of all books, united the various
little kingdoms into one, and it was only in his
time that the Chinese Empire properly so called
began. At this period, too, the name of Thsina, or
China, originally that of the district governed by the
incendiary, came to be given to the whole country.</p>

<p>The most important historical documents are
those making up what is called the <i>Shu-King</i>,
dating from about <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 500, and written by a
certain Kwang-Tsen. This valuable book has
been translated into French by P. Gaubil and L.
Biot, and its history is very romantic. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
supposed that every copy had been burnt by
the agents of Thsin-Chi-Hwang-Ti, but an old
literate, Fu Chang by name, had learnt it by heart,
and later, one copy engraved on pieces of bamboo
was found hidden in the wall of an old house
which was being pulled down.</p>

<p>This sacred book, which is indeed a literary
treasure, is now more than 2300 years old, and
it contains extracts from works yet more ancient,
so that it is the very best guide in existence to
the early history of China.</p>

<p>It begins with a description of a chief named
Yao, who, according to official Chinese chronology,
flourished some 2350 years before the Christian
era. If the portrait is not flattered, Yao must
have been a perfect man. He lived in the province
now known as Chen-si, and, like some great
illumination, he attracted to himself all the barbaric
hordes in the neighbourhood. His first care was
to teach them to honour the Shang Ti, or Tien,
that is to say, the Supreme God. He also employed
certain men to watch the course of the
heavenly bodies, or rather to continue the study
of the stars begun before his time, not from any
curiosity as to the science of astronomy strictly
so called, but that agriculturists might learn the
right seasons for the work they had to perform.
According to the <i>Shu-King</i> the year was already
divided in China into 366 days, and these days
into four very strictly-defined periods, beginning at
the times enumerated below:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WISDOM OF YAO</div>

<p>1. The day and night of equal length, marking
the middle of the spring season, or what is now
known in Europe as the Equinox.</p>

<p>2. The longest day, marking the middle of the
summer, now called the summer solstice.</p>

<p>3. The day and night of equal length, marking
the middle of the autumn.</p>

<p>4. The shortest day, marking the middle of the
winter solstice.</p>

<p>Yao having asked for a man capable of aiding
him to govern his people well, his own son was
the first to be suggested as a suitable person, but
he was rejected, the father saying: "He is deficient
in rectitude, and fond of disputing." Another
candidate was sent away because he did a great
deal of unnecessary talking about things of no
value, and pretended to be humble although his
pride was really boundless. Then a certain Chung
was brought forward, renowned for his virtues in
spite of his obscure birth. Although he was the
son of a blind father and of a wicked mother who
treated him cruelly, whilst his brother was puffed
up with excessive pride, Chung yet loyally performed
his filial duties, and even succeeded as it
were unconsciously in correcting the errors of his
relations, and saving them from the commission
of serious crimes. He was quoted as the greatest
known example of the practice of that most
honoured of all virtues in China, filial piety, which
is looked upon by the Celestials as the source of
every good action of justice and of humanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Chung therefore was chosen, and he did not
disappoint the hopes Yao had founded upon his
rectitude and ability. The sacred book praises
the justice of his administration, and he succeeded
Yao on that great ruler's death, proving that the
hereditary principle was considered dangerous in
China even at that remote date. He commenced
his reign by offering to the Supreme God, and
performed the customary ceremonies in honour of
the mountains, the flowers and the spirits, then
held in veneration. He took the greatest pains
to ensure that justice should be done to all. It
is evident that there were schools in his day, for
he gave orders that nothing but the bamboo should
be used for the correction of insubordinate pupils.
Chung wished faults committed without malice
prepense to be pardoned, but severe punishments
to be inflicted on the incorrigible and on those
who abused their strength or their authority. He
was anxious, however, that judges under him should
temper their justice with mercy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A LOWLY-BORN RULER</div>

<p>The ministers of state had names suggesting a
pastoral origin, for they were all called Mon, a
word answering to our shepherd. When Chung
gave them their appointments, he would say to
them: "You must treat those who come from a
distance with humanity, instruct those who are
near to you, esteem and encourage men of talent,
believe in the virtuous and charitable and confide
in them, and lastly have nothing to do with those
whose manners are corrupt." He would also say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
to them sometimes: "If I do wrong you must tell
me of it; you would be to blame if you praise me
to my face and speak differently of me when my
back is turned."</p>

<p>The <i>Shu-King</i> tells us further that having
appointed a man skilled in music to teach that art
to the children of the great ones of his kingdom,
Chung said to him: "See that your pupils are
sincere and polite, ready to make allowances for
others, obliging and sedate; teach them to be
firm without being cruel; inculcate discernment,
but take care that they do not become conceited."
He appointed a censor to preside over public
meetings where speeches were made, saying to
him: "I have an extreme aversion for those who
use inflammatory language; their harangues sow
discord, and do much to injure the work of those
who endeavour to do good; the excitement and
the fears they arouse lead to public disorders."</p>

<p>Would it not be well for a similar formula to be
pasted up in every place of public meeting at the
present day?</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 301px;"><a id="Fig_12"></a><br />
<img src="images/fig12.png" width="301" height="266" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">FIG. 12.&mdash;A NAUGHTY PUPIL.</div>
</div>

<p>Every three years Chung instituted an inquiry
into the conduct of the officials in his dominions,
recompensing those who had done well, and
punishing those who had done ill. Few other
sovereigns have merited the eulogy pronounced
on Chung by one of his ministers: "His virtues,
said the critic, are not tarnished by faults. In the
care he takes of his subjects, he shows great
moderation, and in his government his grandeur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of soul is manifest If he has to punish, <i>the punishment
does not descend from parents to children;</i>
but if he has to give a reward, the benefit extends
to the descendants of those recompensed. With
regard to involuntary errors, he pardons them
without inquiring whether they are great or small.
Voluntary faults, however apparently trivial, he
punishes. In doubtful cases the penalty inflicted
is light, but
if a service
rendered is
in question,
the reward is
great. He
would rather
run the risk
of letting a
criminal escape the legal
punishment
than of putting an innocent person to death." The same minister thus
defines a fortunate man: "He is one who knows
how to combine prudence with indulgence, determination
with integrity, reserve with frankness,
humility with great talents, consistency with complaisance,
justice and accuracy with gentleness,
moderation with discernment, a high spirit with
docility, and power with equity."</p>

<div class="sidenote">A BOASTFUL ENGINEER</div>

<p>The Hoang-Ho, or Yellow River, the mighty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
stream which rises in Thibet and flings itself into
the Gulf of Pechili after a course of some 3000
miles, had from time immemorial been the cause
of constant and terrible catastrophes in the districts
it traversed. Chung therefore sent for a talented
engineer named Yu, and ordered him to superintend
the work of making canals and embankments to
remedy the evil. There had been a specially
destructive inundation just before this appointment,
and the sacred book contains Yu's own
account of what he had accomplished, couched, it
must be owned, in anything but modest terms.
"When," he says, "the great flood reached to
heaven; when it surrounded the mountains and
covered the hills, the unfortunate inhabitants were
overwhelmed by the waters. Then I climbed on
to the four means of transport. I followed the
mountains, and I cut through the woods. I laid
up stores of grain and meat to feed the people. I
made channels for the river, compelling them to
flow towards the sea. In the country I dug canals
to connect the rivers with each other. I planted
seed in the earth, and by dint of work something
to live upon was won from the soil."</p>

<p>The memory of these vast undertakings has
remained engraven on the minds of the Chinese,
and they still think of Yu with undying gratitude.
For all that, however, the Hoang-Ho has continued
to be a menace to the Empire, for in 1789, and again
in 1819, it overflowed its banks, causing a considerable
amount of damage to property, and killing
countless numbers of the river-side population. Only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
twelve years ago the wayward river, justly called
by the sufferers from its ravages "China's sorrow,"
burst its southern embankment near Chang-Chan
in the inland province of Shen-Hsi, and poured in one
great mass over the whole of the densely-populated
Honan, drowning millions of helpless people, and
undoing the work of centuries. In a word, what
the erratic river will do next is one of the chief
problems of the physical future of China. It has
already shifted its course no less than nine times
in its troubled career; and on account of the great
rapidity of its stream it is of little use for navigation.
Could Yu have foreseen the destruction
of all the grand works of which he boasted, he
would probably have taken a less exalted view of
what he had accomplished.</p>

<p>However that may be, his contemporaries were
so impressed by his ability, and the great Chung so
admired his virtue and talent, that he was chosen
as heir in the life-time of that mighty sovereign.
The dialogue said to have taken place between
the Emperor and his subject on the question of
the succession to the throne is curious and
interesting:</p>

<p>"Come," said Chung to Yu, "I have been reigning
for thirty-three years; my advanced age and
growing infirmities prevent me from giving the
necessary application to affairs of state. I wish
you to reign instead. Do your utmost to acquit
yourself worthily of the task."</p>

<p>"I am not virtuous enough to govern well,"
replied Yu; "the people will not obey me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>He then recommended some one else.</p>

<p>Chung, however, insisted in the following terms:</p>

<p>"When we had everything to fear from the great
inundation, you worked with eagerness and rectitude;
you rendered the greatest services, and your
talents and wisdom were made manifest throughout
the whole country. Although you have led an
unassuming life with your family, although you have
served the State well, you have not considered that
a reason to dispense with work, and this is no
ordinary virtue. You have no pride; there is no
one in the country superior to you in good qualities.
None other has done such great things, and yet
you do not set a high value on your own conduct.
There is no one in the country whose merit excels
your own."</p>

<div class="fig_caption">FIG. 13.&mdash;A CHINESE BRIDGE SPANNING THE HUANG-HO.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">YU BECOMES EMPEROR</div>

<p>So Yu became chief ruler, and his name was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
associated by posterity with that of Yao and of
Chung. The sacred book has preserved many of
his sayings, and I will quote the most beautiful
here:</p>

<p>"He who obeys reason is happy, he who resists
it is unhappy. Virtue is the foundation of good
government; the first task of government is to
provide the people governed with all that is
necessary for their subsistence and preservation.
The next thing is to make the population virtuous;
to teach them the proper use of everything; and
lastly, to protect them from all which jeopardizes
their health or their life. The prince who understands
men well will appoint none to public offices
but those who are wise; his generous heart and
liberality will win him love."</p>

<p>When Yu died, the chiefs of the people unfortunately
failed to carry on the custom of choosing
as a successor to the throne the wisest and most
illustrious of their number. The law of hereditary
right was recognized, and dynasties henceforth
succeeded each other in China as elsewhere, each
lasting a long or short time according to whether
the people were or were not satisfied. There was,
however, one salutary exception to the usual
interpretation of the hereditary principle. The
reigning Emperor could choose as his successor
the son he considered the most intelligent of his
children; and as a Chinese ruler generally has at
least fifty children, without counting the girls,
there is no difficulty in making a selection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Well-built</span>, comfortable steamers leave Hong-Kong
daily for Canton. I embarked in one of
them one fine spring morning, when a fresh sea-breeze
was blowing, such as gives new life to those
enervated by too long a residence in the tropics.
I did not see a single white face amongst the
passengers, for European trade is all transferred to
Hong-Kong, now driven away from Canton by
the burning by the Celestials of the fine factories
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
built outside the gates of the city by European
contractors.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 211px;"><a id="Fig_14"></a><br />
<img src="images/fig14.png" width="211" height="477" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">FIG. 14.&mdash;A PAGODA.</div>
</div>

<p>My fellow-passengers, all Chinese, wore loose
garments of blue cotton,
thick-soled shoes, and a
skull-cap, from which a
long pig-tail, in many
cases of false hair, hung
down the back, reaching
to the heels. The crew
of American sailors as
they navigated the vessel
kept a watchful eye upon
the passengers, for
though the latter looked
peaceable enough, there
had been more than one
instance of the sudden
transformation of inoffensive
travellers into
daring pirates, who, after
pillaging and burning
the ship, had made for
the nearest shore and
escaped the vengeance of
those they had robbed.</p>

<p>Before entering the great Shu-Kiang river, on
the north bank of which Canton is built, we
passed the ruins of a fort dating from the time of
the Dutch supremacy. Beyond it the stream is
bordered by green rice plantations with little hills
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
rising up here and there surmounted by isolated
pagodas of several storeys high. On one of them I
noticed standing out against the sky from the fifth
storey the fragment of a bell, one-half of which had
been shot away by a ball from a French cannon.
Great indeed must have been the astonishment of
the Chinese, posted on this particular pagoda to
watch the movements of the enemies' troops, when
the projectile struck the sonorous mass of bronze
and shivered it to splinters. The catastrophe must
have been to them a warning full of sinister yet
salutary meaning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PEARL OF THE EAST</div>

<p>The river rushes proudly along towards its final
home in the ocean, but narrows before it reaches its
actual mouth, the water becoming yellow, as does
that of the Nile at the time of its rising. Even without
glasses I could quite clearly make out several poor-looking
villages, the houses with their dull red roofs
occupied no doubt by fishermen and their families.
Oh, how different were the surroundings of these
water-highways of China to those of the Seine, the
Rhone, and of the charming Gironde! How much
I preferred even the Nile, which I had but recently
left, to this so-called Pearl of the East, for in spite
of the ugly black mud-huts of the fellaheen, there
is something beautiful about the river-side scenery.
I like the graceful date-tree far better than the
bamboo with its self-conscious uprightness, and I
considerably prefer the slim and supple Egyptian
women to the clumsy, heavy-limbed female peasants
of China, such as I saw on the banks of the Shu-Kiang,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
dragging heavy loads behind them as they
strode along in a manner which made me doubtful
as to their sex, especially as their faces were hidden
by the great hats they wore. A few more turns of
the paddle-wheels of our steamer, and it stopped
opposite Canton. In a moment a virago, such as
those I had been looking at with anything but
admiration, was on the deck, and seizing me in her
strong arms as if I were a delicate baby, she quickly
deposited me at the bottom of her own boat,
roaring with laughter over my embarrassment. I
had no longer any doubt as to her sex, as with a
few vigorous strokes of her oars she ran her boat
ashore, and with the same maternal care as she had
shown before she landed me upon the wharf of the
little island of Hainan where I was expected.</p>

<p>There is no particular historic interest attached
to Canton except that it was the very first Chinese
town to enter into relations with foreigners. We
know that this opening of intercourse took place
in the year 618 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, but whence the foreigners
came is not so certain. Possibly some of them
were from Ceylon, and undoubtedly others were
from the continent of Africa, as proved by the fact
that elephants' tusks, the horns of the rhinoceros,
coral, pearls, redwood, and medicines were brought
into the city by the strangers, who received metals
in exchange&mdash;that is to say, copper, tin, and gold,
and silk&mdash;especially silk&mdash;for it was manufactured
in the Celestial Empire twenty-seven centuries
before the Christian era. It was Lui-Tseu, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
wife of the great Emperor Kwang-Ti, or the Yellow
ruler, who taught the people the art of rearing the
silk-worm and spinning the material it produced.
The industry of silk-weaving has brought such
wealth to China that Lui-Tseu has been raised to
the rank of a beneficent genius, and is honoured
under the name of the "Spirit of the mulberry-tree
and the silk-worm."</p>

<p>In 1127 an edict was issued forbidding the exportation
of metal, and ordering all payments to
be made from henceforth in money alone. It is
recorded in Chinese annals that at a considerably
later date a French vessel came up the river Shu-Kiang
and fired her cannons in an aggressive
manner, so that relations with foreigners were
broken off.</p>

<p>In 1425, however, an embassy from Portugal
resulted in the re-admission of foreigners to Canton,
and a century later the Dutch also obtained a
footing in the city.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENGLISH MONOPOLY OF TRADE</div>

<p>They in their turn were, however, supplanted by
the English, who practically enjoyed a monopoly
of trade from the beginning of the eighteenth
century until 1834. At that date their prosperity
began to decline, one dispute succeeding another,
and in 1839 open war broke out between England
and China. In 1841 Hong-Kong was ceded to the
former power, and in 1842 the Treaty of Nanking
was signed, opening to British traders the five ports
of Canton, Amoy, Fuchau, Ningpo, and Shanghai.
Fresh friction was caused by the arrogant assumptions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
of the Chinese and the vacillating policy of
the English, culminating in the war of 1856, the
immediate cause of which was the capture by the
Chinese of a lorcha, or small hybrid vessel of
European build, with the rigging of a Chinese junk
flying the British flag. After a fierce struggle a
peace was again patched up, but the factories outside
Canton had all been destroyed by the mob,
and prosperity has never since fully returned to the
city. It was not until 1860, when the Convention
of Pekin was signed, ratifying the Treaty of Tien-tsin,
that anything like cordial relations were established
between England and China, and since
then these relations have been again and again
disturbed.</p>

<p>Before the bombardment of Canton by the united
fleets of England and France every foreigner found
within the walls of that inhospitable town was
beheaded at once. Naturally, with the memory
of all that had so recently happened fresh in my
mind, I hesitated when M. Vaucher, representative
on the island of Hainan, of the Swiss house of the
same name, suggested that we should go together
through the streets of Canton in sedan chairs. I
did not like to allude to the danger I might run
myself, but I asked if I should not be exposing
him to peril. "No," was his reply, "your fellow-countrymen
have won the permanent respect of
the people for all foreigners, and you will be able
to boast on your return home of having explored
the vast city with no other protector than myself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A TERRIBLE REVENGE</div>

<p>M. Vaucher then told me the following story:</p>

<p>"After the allied fleets had taken possession of
Canton, the commanders used to send a party of
men every morning to get fresh fruit for the table
of the officers, and rarely did a day pass without
at least one Englishman being absent at calling
over. Any sailor, who to satisfy his curiosity was
foolish enough to leave his comrades for a moment,
was at once set upon by Chinese soldiers and
murdered in the open street. Vainly did the
Admiral of the English fleet threaten to make
bloody reprisals if the authorities did not punish
the offenders. The same kind of thing happened
again and again. At last one day five or six sailors
belonging to a French frigate landed and made
their way into Canton. As they turned into a
street they missed one of their party, and presently
they found his headless corpse lying on the ground.
When the crime became known to the French, the
second in command of the fleet collected fifty
volunteers, armed them with revolvers and hatchets,
and landing with them, marched them into Canton.
On arriving in the street where the murder had been
committed, some of the men were told off to guard
the entrances to it, whilst the rest made their way
into the houses and killed all the Chinese they
found in them except one, who, though he had
already been hit by six bullets, calmly walked up
the middle of the street without quickening his
pace or even turning his head to the right or the
left at the sound of the renewed firing. The leader
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of the expedition at last ran up to him and gave
him a smart blow on the shoulder. The fearless
Celestial merely turned his pale face towards his
assailant, looking at him without a smile. He
did not even
tremble in the
grasp of his
enemy. Touched
by his courage
the officer spared
his life handing
him over to two
sailors with orders to do him
no harm.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">FIG. 15.&mdash;A STREET IN CANTON.</div>
</div>

<p>"After this bloody punishment, which was very
hostilely criticized by the English press of Hong-Kong and Shanghai,
Europeans, whatever their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
nationality, have been able to wander about unmolested either alone
or in parties in the streets of Canton."</p>

<div class="fig_caption">FIG. 16.&mdash;A WOMAN OF THE PEOPLE WITH HER BABY.</div>
</div>

<p>After listening to this tale, I had an eager desire
to explore the town, which, since the departure
of the allied fleets, had
rarely been entered
by Europeans. I
watched anxiously
for the first symptom
in the faces of the
inhabitants of the
hereditary hatred of
white men, which had
most likely been
greatly intensified by
the bombardment of
the town, and by the
punishment inflicted
for the murder of the
French sailors, a punishment by no means
excessive, terrible as
it was. I am bound
to add, however, that
as M. Vaucher and I
were carried rapidly through the crowded streets
by our coolies, in our respective chairs, we noted
no hostility in the placid faces of those we encountered.
The people stood aside to let us pass, and
showed rather benevolent curiosity than insulting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
indifference. The Chinese children, with their
round heads and strongly-marked eyebrows, who
are so aggressive and impudent in the interior of
the country, here remained perfectly silent. Only
the old women tottering along on their deformed
feet paused in their painful
walk now and then, to lean
against the walls of the
houses, and look at us in
a mocking though not
exactly a hostile manner.
Our progress was only once
arrested for a moment,
when we met a great military
mandarin in a narrow
street, escorted by some ten
warriors bearing their halberds
on their shoulders.
The mandarin stopped, and
we passed without difficulty,
giving him a military
salute in return for
his courtesy.</p>

<p>I confess that this unexpected complaisance
put me into a very good humour, and after this
incident I gave myself up without reserve to the
enjoyment of my first visit to a Chinese town.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOMAGE TO PAKTAI</div>

<p>By a lucky chance I had arrived at the very
moment when the inhabitants were celebrating two
of their greatest festivals. The first, in honour of
the beautiful Paktai, the fair Divinity of the North,
was simply remarkable for the immense crowds
flocking to the pagodas, crowds made up of bonzes,
bonzesses, portly mandarins, cooks and barbers
vigorously plying their trades, Ã¦sthetes with
effeminate faces, young girls
full of delight at getting out
of their palanquins for once,
and at being able to totter
about on the flag-stones of
the temples for a few minutes
on their poor mutilated feet.</p>

<p>When the gilded pedestal
upholding the shrine of
Paktai was completely hidden
beneath the flowers
flung upon it by the crowds,
the worshippers all repaired
<i>en masse</i> to see the theatrical
representations which take
place after the religious ceremony.
Not until midnight
did every one go home, only
to meet again the next day,
when a great procession passed through the city, in
the midst of which the venerated idol was carried
with the greatest pomp. Some on horseback, others
in sedan chairs, were many young boys and girls
wearing the costumes in vogue amongst the heroes
and heroines of the earliest days of the Celestial
Empire. Many too were the banners of beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
silk embroidered with various devices or inscriptions
in golden letters, and still more numerous
were the bearers of the large gongs, some of which
were of such
an immense circumference
that
it took two
strong coolies to
carry them.</p>

<p>All Asiatics
love a deafening
noise, and the
delight of the
Chinese may be
imagined when
the accumulated
din of these
great bronze
disks becomes
one continuous
roar like thunder.</p>

<p>The second
<i>fÃ©te</i> I witnessed
was celebrated
in the Honan
suburb in honour
of Tien-Ho, the
Queen of Heaven, and the protectress of sailors.
All the ship-owners of the populous city of Canton,
all the pilots, all the captains of junks and sampans,
all the fishermen, boatmen, and boatwomen,&mdash;in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
fact, every human creature connected in
the remotest degree with anything like shipping or
boats, were collected in front of the sanctuary of
the goddess. Her statue too was covered with
flowers, and, as in the case of the <i>fÃ©te</i> of the
Divinity of the North, the theatre opened directly
the pagoda of the Queen of Heaven closed. The
stage was erected about a hundred yards from
the pagoda, so that the devout had only to turn
round to pass at once from the sacred to the
profane.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A GRAND DRAMA</div>

<p>A grand spectacular drama, called the Marriage
of the Ocean and the Earth, extended over twelve
consecutive evenings; the only plot was, however,
the presentation to each other by the betrothed
couple of the vast treasures at their disposal.</p>

<p>The Earth began by a grand show of tigers,
lions, elephants, ostriches, etc.&mdash;in a word, of all the
big animals which our ancestor Noah took with
him into the ark. Then the Ocean, not to be outdone,
paraded in his turn his dolphins, his turtles,
the vessels he had engulfed, his corals, and great
bunches of all the most wonderful growths of his
submarine gardens. All these marvels were, however,
nothing but a prelude to the great final
surprise, when an enormous whale reeled into view,
and as it flopped about shot out a great volume
of water over the whole stage. It would be impossible
to describe the enthusiastic delight of the
spectators, who all shouted like madmen. <i>Has!
Hung haho!</i> (excellent! perfect!) and if M.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Vaucher and I had not applauded too we should
have been stoned.</p>

<p>The beautiful river on which Canton is built
presented for many days a most picturesque appearance.
I could wish those of my readers who
love the marvellous, who enjoy looking at crowds
and do not mind noise, no better pleasure than to
gaze, if but for a moment, upon the Pearl of the
East at this <i>fÃ©te</i> of the protectress of those who
do their business on the great waters, thronged as
its surface then is with junks dressed with flags,
brilliantly illuminated flower-boats, little vessels
transformed for the nonce into miniature pagodas,
gliding mysteriously along as do the gondolas of
Venice. I was told that on these occasions more
than one lovely young Celestial maiden is worshipped
in these pagodas of a day, with a ritual
very different from that of the public ceremony we
had witnessed at the shrine of the goddess.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CANTON INDUSTRIES</div>

<p>Canton consists of a great number of narrow
streets, each house in which is adorned with
coloured signs, giving a very quaint and charming
appearance to the faÃ§ades, especially of an evening,
when the gilt lettering on the red and black lacquer
ground is lit up by the rays of the setting sun. As
was the case in European towns in mediÃ¦val times,
and is still customary in the Orient, each district
of the city has its own special industry, and is
closed at nightfall by a bamboo barrier. The
cobblers' quarter seemed to me to be the most
densely populated; a great multitude of workers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
naked to the waist, zealously plying their trade,
chattering like magpies the while. Close to the
cobblers live the coffin-makers, who are even
noisier than their neighbours, and quite as happy
over their work. Yet another quarter dear to the
lovers of <i>bric-Ã -brac</i>, is
sacred to the manufacture
of porcelain,
bronzes, cloisonnÃ©
enamels, beautifully
lacquered or delicately
carved boxes in ebony,
ivory, and other materials,
plain and figured
silks, etc., which are
sent to Hong-Kong
for trans-shipment to
Europe and America.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">FIG. 20.&mdash;A CHINESE ACTOR IN A TRAGIC PART.</div>
</div>

<p>You can of course
get all these things
without going all the
way to China for them,
and they are to be seen
in Paris in the Guimet
and Cernuschi Museums,
and at various Oriental houses in London and
New York. Many Chinese are very wealthy, and
keep for themselves and their heirs the art treasures
they buy or have inherited from their ancestors.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that you can see Chinese
curios at home, it would be a pity to miss the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
pleasure of rummaging, in the shops. The owner
of those you enter will receive you with apparent
cordiality, but at the same time with a certain
distrustful politeness, and you will be carefully
watched as you turn over the goods for sale. If
you accept the cup of tea which every merchant
delights to offer to his visitors, and you seem to
appreciate the superior quality of the beverage, you
will win the golden opinion of the donor, for to the
Celestial tea is a divine plant. The drink made
from it as a matter of fact quenches thirst better
than any other, not only in the heat of summer,
but also in the extreme cold of the heights of the
Himalayas or of the desert of Gobi, where the traveller
is exposed to the icy blast of the north wind.
From the east to the west, from the north to the
south of the vast Empire, we meet with the hospitable
tea-house; it is perhaps not quite such a
fascinating place as it is in Japan, but beneath its
shelter the traveller is always sure of finding the
cheering beverage which will put new strength into
him for his further journey. There is not a Chinese
poet who has failed to sing the praises of the
precious shrub. Even an illustrious Emperor wrote
directions in verse (reproduced below in dull
prose) for the preparation of a cup of tea, and
described the salutary effect it has upon the
mind:</p>

<div class="pmb2 blockquot">

<p>"Put a tripod pot, the colour and form of which testifies
to long service, upon a moderate fire; fill this pot with the
pure water of melted snow, and heat this water to the degree
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
needed for turning fish white or crabs red, and then pour
it at once into a cup containing the tender leaves of a choice
tea; leave it to simmer until the steam, which will at first rise
up copiously, forms thick clouds which gradually disperse,
till all that is left is a light mist upon the surface; then sip
the delicious liquor slowly; it will effectually dissipate all
the causes for anxiety which are worrying you. You can
taste, you can feel the peaceful bliss which results from
imbibing the liquid thus prepared, but it is perfectly impossible
to describe it. Already, however, I hear the ringing
of the curfew-bell; the freshness of the night is increasing;
the moonbeams penetrate through the slits in my tent, and
light up the few pieces of furniture adorning it. I am without
anxiety and without fatigue, my digestion is perfect; I
can give myself to repose without fear. These verses were
written to the best of my small ability, in the spring of the
tenth month of the year Ping-yn (1746) of my reign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN IMPERIAL TEA-MAKER</div>

<p>The tea-plant is a shrub requiring very little
care. A siliceous soil suits it best, and in it it
attains its fullest development. Great quantities
of seed are sown in September and October, and
when the plants are about nine inches high they
are transplanted and placed about twenty inches
apart. When the leaves have reached their fullest
development they are gathered, carefully washed
to remove any earth which may have clung to
them, and they are then exposed to the rays of the
sun, the day chosen for this part of the preparation
being the very hottest in the year. In the evening
the dry leaves are taken up with every precaution
against injury, placed in boxes, and protected from
the air by sheets of lead. Millions of cases of tea
thus packed are dispersed all over the world, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
it is needless to add that the Chinese keep the
best leaves for their own consumption. Green, or as
they themselves call it, white tea, is put into boxes
directly it is picked, without any drying or other
preparation, and black tea is produced by placing
the leaves in a brazier over a slow fire, these leaves
being constantly turned over with the hands by
the men in charge of them, to prevent them from
sticking together or drying too quickly. When
taken from the brazier they are placed in a sieve
and still further manipulated, always with the
greatest care and delicacy. Lastly, they are once
more exposed to heat in the brazier to give them
the brown colour so much esteemed by many
consumers. It is in this last stage of the preparation
that the skill of the manipulator is put to the
severest test, for if the tea is too much burnt it will
have no taste at all, and if it is not sufficiently
burnt it will be bitter and heating.</p>

<p>I forget now in whose house it was, but I was on
one occasion stupid enough, when the guest of a
mandarin, to say I had once at the residence of
a clergyman drunk an excellent cup of tea mixed
with rum and sweetened with sugar.</p>

<p>"Sugar and rum!" cried my host, who was
terribly shocked. "We must take care not to
offer our best teas to you, for you would certainly
not be able to appreciate them."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FATIM GARDEN</div>

<p>I stopped eight days at Canton; more than
enough to visit everything worth seeing in that
now uninteresting city. I saw the endless rice-fields
stretching away beyond its gates; I went to
look at the French concession, where there is not a
single French inhabitant, though the names of the
streets, such as the <i>Rue de la FusÃ©e</i>, the <i>Rue de la
Dordogne</i>, and the <i>Rue de la Charente</i>, recall the
vessels once manned by the brave sailors who had
for a brief time sojourned in this remote Chinese
town. One curiosity which every visitor to Canton
ought to see, is the so-called Fatim garden, where
each tree represents some fantastic animal, and in
which prowl herds of pigs, more quaint in appearance
than the shrubs tended by pale-faced young
bonzes wearing yellow garments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>The cemetery of Canton is of vast extent, and
every year in the month of May, the pious Celestials
all flock to it in white robes, to lay offerings of
rice, fruit, and flowers on the graves of those they
have lost. The gifts would be left unmolested for a
long time, but for the fact that they are presented
in the spring, just when countless birds are nesting
in the branches of the lofty bamboos growing in
the neighbourhood, and who consequently look upon
the rice and fruit as provided especially for them.</p>

<p>It is not only after the death of those near
and dear to them, that the Chinese show the deep
filial love for their parents which is one of their most
striking characteristics. The <i>Pekin Gazette</i> gave
a very touching instance of this reverent affection,
communicated to the official organ of the Celestial
Empire by the Governor of Schantung, which made
such a sensation that it reached the ears of the
Emperor himself. Here is the story:</p>

<p>A certain native of China, Li-Hsien-Ju by name,
whose father had died at FeÃ¯-Chang, immediately
sold the piece of land he inherited in order to give
a grand funeral in honour of his beloved and
lamented father. The time of mourning had not
yet expired when a terrible famine took place in
the town where the ceremonies were going on.
Provisions became so scarce and so dear, that Li-Hsien-Ju
found himself quite unable to provide
properly for his aged mother, so he decided to
carry her on his back to another province where
the ground was less sterile. This he did, begging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
his way as he went, and supporting himself and
his sacred charge on alms alone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A DEVOTED SON</div>

<p>This model son, laden as he was, actually
traversed the fabulous distance of four hundred
French leagues, finally arriving at Honan, where he
and his mother settled down. A year after this the
poor mother was taken ill, and Li-Hsien-Ju, fearing
that she might die in a strange land, of which every
Chinese has the greatest horror, resolved to take
her home to her native country in the same manner
as he had brought her from it, so he started back
again with his sacred burden, begging his way
once more. The two got back again to FeÃ¯-Chang
at last, but had scarcely reached their home before
the old mother died. It is impossible to tell how
many nights the heart-broken son spent on the
tomb of the lost one, but we know that, thanks to
his pious efforts, the bones of his father were laid
beside the body of his mother. A few days after
the death of the latter, the grief of the orphan
became so terrible that he wept tears of blood.
He is now sixty years old, but he still mourns for
his parents, and in the month of May when the <i>fÃ©te</i>
of the dead is held, he never fails to drag himself to
the cemetery and place upon the tomb, according
to custom, a bowl of smoking rice of gleaming
whiteness.</p>

<p>There are no Monthyon prizes, such as those
given by the French Academy for acts of disinterested
goodness, or surely this unselfish son
would have received one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>M. Vaucher and I went to visit the quay outside
Canton, which was the scene of the massacre of
100,000 Tai-Ping rebels, after the defeat of Hung-Hsiu-ch'wan
in 1865. The ferocious mandarin
Yeh had them all decapitated at the edge of the
river Kwan-Tung, their heads falling into the
muddy stream. A Dutchman, who had belonged
to a factory in Canton at the time, told me that he
witnessed the terrible scene from his window, and
had been greatly struck by the extraordinary
composure with which the victims met their fate.
Motionless and with bowed heads they knelt at
the edge of the quay, awaiting the fatal stroke of
the sword. "I had some idea," added the Dutchman,
"of sending the poor fellows some packets of
cigarettes to cheer their last moments, but I should
have been completely ruined, for their numbers
increased every day."</p>

<p>The tragic story of the Tai-Ping rebellion, its
extraordinary success at first, and its final suppression
under Gordon is well known. In the two
campaigns against the Tai-Pings, the future hero
of Khartoum fought no less than thirty-three
battles, besieging and taking numerous walled
cities, and changing the whole history of the vast
Celestial Empire. Had the revolt been finally
successful, as it at one time bid fair to be, Hung,
the enlightened leader, might have founded a new
dynasty, and warded off for a long time at least
the dismemberment of the once vast Empire of
the East.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A CHINESE PANTHEON</div>

<p>My last visit was to the so-called Temple of
the live hundred genii, containing five hundred
grotesque gilded statues, taller than life, and of a
surprising girth. We must not, however, make fun
of them, for each one represents some Celestial
who has made his mark in art, science, or philosophy.
In France such a temple would be called
a Pantheon, and that is what it really is, a place
set apart for the commemoration of the great ones
of the past.</p>

<p>In the Temple of the five hundred genii lived a
beautiful little water-snake, which a bonze of venerable
appearance tended with reverent care, feeding
it on green frogs and cantharides. I tried to find
out why he set such store upon it, and the following
story was told to me:</p>

<p>The river, from the banks of which rises the
great city of Canton, often overflows, and the
inundations caused by the excess of water do a
great deal of mischief to the rice plantations. A
young engineer was ordered to construct an embankment,
but he must have done his work badly,
for only a year after its completion the river again
burst its bounds, and the engineer in despair
drowned himself in the waters he had failed to
control. Yet another inundation took place after
his death, and in the mud cast up by it upon the
shore was found a little snake. By order of the
Viceroy the reptile was taken to the Temple of the
five hundred genii, and a miracle at once took place,
for it had no sooner entered the sacred precincts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
than the waters subsided. Every one attributed
their fall to gratitude for the kind welcome given
to the little snake, and a long memorial on the subject
was addressed by the Viceroy to the Emperor,
which was at once published by the <i>Pekin Gazette</i>.
An explanation of the phenomenon was added, to
the effect that the little snake was really none other
than the engineer who had committed suicide.
There was really nothing surprising in the matter,
for of course by his death the unfortunate young
man had become a Chen-Ching-tung-Chang-chan,
or divinity of the river, and was anxious to repair
the mistake made in his life-time on earth, by
exercising a benevolent influence over its waters
now that he had the power to do so.</p>

<p>After the miracle which had taken place on the
entrance into the Temple of the little snake, the
people had proclaimed it to be the genius of the
water, and as such they venerated and cherished it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Tcheng-Ki-Tong</span>, who lived so long
in France and married a French lady, although
rumour says he already had a wife in China, wrote
a very interesting but far from exhaustive book,
with the title, <i>The Chinese described by themselves</i>.
He said nothing in it of the worship of great men
and of certain animals in his native land, nor did
he refer to the way in which acts of virtue and of
courage are rewarded there.</p>

<p>I will now endeavour to supplement the information

addition to the statues erected in China, as in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
chief cities of Europe, to every man who has in
any way distinguished himself, triumphal arches
are set up in memory of those who have done
heroic deeds, whether in the privacy of home life
or in public. These arches are known as <i>Pai-lans</i>,
or Honorary Portals, and as a rule they have three
arcades, sometimes made of very fine stone worked
with considerable
skill, and
surmounted by
a roof of varnished
canvas
with the corners
gracefully
turned upwards
as is the fashion
in China. There
are two kinds
of monuments
in the Celestial
Empire, one of
very ornate, the
other of simple construction.</p>

<p>Widows who refuse to marry again; virgins who
have kept their vows of chastity till their death;
men who have distinguished themselves in science,
literature, or philosophy; diplomatists who by their
skill in deception have mystified their colleagues
as well as foreign ministers, and thus won a reputation
for great wisdom; soldiers who have fought
valiantly for their country; women who have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
committed suicide after a lost battle; wealthy men
who have given much away in charity; families
who have lived for many generations in one house;
old men who can assemble in the home of their
ancestors four living and healthy representatives
of four generations, are honoured by the erection
of Honorary Portals, which are also set up in
general commemoration of any victory or series
of victories in war.</p>

<p>In the centre of the larger and grander monuments
are inscribed three words, signifying Faith,
Submission, and Justice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MONUMENTS TO WIDOWS</div>

<p>The Imperial Government of China goes out of
its way to honour certain acts of abstinence, such
as the refusal of a widow to marry again, erecting
a monument to her when she has been true to her
resolve till she is fifty years old, and has lived
alone for at least twenty years. I must add that
the Emperor himself contributes forty piastres, or
about eight English pounds, to the expense of
erecting monuments in honour of women who
have been true to the memory of their husbands;
he also gives a roll of silk to each inconsolable
widow, and what is more, he has written a poem
on widowhood. Who shall say after all this that
the Chinese are not jealous of marital faithfulness?
Monuments to widows are more imposing
than any others, and bear an inscription signifying
Chastity and Purity.</p>

<p>An affianced couple, who, though engaged in
early childhood, have been prevented through some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
local rebellion, or through a foreign war, from
accomplishing their union before they are fifty
years old, are honoured in a similar manner.</p>

<p>A monument with the inscription "Chastity and
Filial Piety" may be erected to glorify a Chinese
mother, who having borne one child, takes a vow
never to have another, in order to be free to devote
herself to the needs of her poor parents. Similar
honour may be done to young boys or girls who
allow a piece of flesh to be taken from their arms
or thighs, under the belief that this flesh mixed
with certain ingredients will do their suffering
parents good. The Imperial Government both approves
and rewards the bloody sacrifice, the motive
of which is that filial love held in such high esteem
throughout the whole Celestial Empire.</p>

<p>On certain monuments with three arcades an
inscription maybe read, signifying, "Joy and Gladness
to the Benevolent." Monuments such as these
are erected in honour of some Chinese who has
brought up orphans as if they were his own children,
or of some rich man who has given a large sum
of money towards the making of roads or bridges.
A kind-hearted employer who pays poor men for
collecting the bones scattered about the cemeteries
and giving them reverent burial, is also often
rewarded by the erection of a monument to his
memory.</p>

<p>Those of the Celestials who distinguish themselves
by charity, but who do not spend large sums
of money, receive tablets of wood, on which are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
inscribed pious sentences composed by the Son of
Heaven, that is to say, the Emperor. Many of these
tablets, which answer the same purpose as did the
Greek <i>stelÃ¦</i>, are to be seen in the rooms known as
the Halls of the Ancestors in the houses of the
Chinese, especially those of the wealthy mandarins.
They constitute regular patents of nobility, and
are not won by favour or intrigue, as are so many
titles in Europe, but by real acts of charity performed
by their owners.</p>

<p>Three brothers, who have all passed their eightieth
year and are still in good health, can have a
monument erected announcing this fact, and so
can husbands or wives who attain the age of one
hundred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A CHINESE HEROINE</div>

<p>At Amoy, in the province of Pecheli, are two
monuments with arcades erected to the memory of
the Chinese women who flung themselves into the
wells of their houses when they heard the shouts of
the English soldiers and sailors entering the town.</p>

<p>This act of despair is explained by the fact that
the Chinese themselves give no quarter when they
enter any place as victors; the men are strangled,
and the women become the slaves of those who
take them prisoners. In the very centre of Canton
is a temple remarkable alike for its size and beauty.
It was built in honour of the memory of a great
Chinese lady, who in December 1857 committed
suicide when the English and French took the
city. This heroine, the wife of Pun-Yu, one of
the chief magistrates at Canton, learning that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
allies already occupied the northern portion of the
town, put on her most magnificent apparel, and
summoning all her servants, gave to each a parting
present. She then killed herself by drinking what
the bonzes call the "cup of immortality," a very
strong poison, containing amongst other ingredients
opium and the droppings of peacocks. This potent
poison has often been given to emperors under
pretext of making them immortal, but really with
a view to getting rid of them.</p>

<p>There is yet another mode of honouring the illustrious
departed. The children of civil and military
officers have the right of erecting avenues of colossal
figures opposite the tombs of their parents; these
figures representing giants or monsters. The length
of the avenues and the size of the figures is regulated
by law, according to the grade of those they
are intended to honour. The state itself pays for
these quaint memorials, unless the necessary sum
has been raised by voluntary subscriptions.</p>

<p>On the death of any illustrious soldier or politician
whose firmness has added to the stability of
the throne, the Emperor always hastens to give
publicity to his grief at the public loss, and
his gratitude for the services rendered by the
deceased. Here is a specimen of an Imperial
proclamation such as is frequently issued:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">AN IMPERIAL EDICT</div>

<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">Imperial Edict.</span></p>

<p>"The deceased K'wo-Fan was a man of great knowledge,
of varied talent, of profound penetration, of stainless
morality, and of incorruptible honesty. He left the schools
with the title of doctor; his merits were discovered by
the Emperor Tao-K'an, who promoted him to the rank of
Chingerh (colonel).</p>

<p>"In the reign of Hsien-Feng, he was commissioned to
raise an army in Hunan, and after the battles in which he
was victorious over the Tai-Ping rebels, he received the
praises of the Emperor and the thanks of the whole country.
It was then that my predecessor appointed him to the vice-royalty
of the two Kiangs, and named him Generalissimo
of the Imperial forces. During my own reign I made him
chief Secretary of State. He became to me a second self;
he was my life, my heart, and my backbone. I therefore
bestowed on him the title of hereditary count, and I authorized
him to wear the double peacock's feather. I had hoped
that he would live long for me to heap fresh favours upon
him, so that the news of his death has filled me with sorrow
and dismay. I wish that according to custom three thousand
taÃ«ls<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> should be spent on his funeral. A jarful of wine shall
also be poured out on his tomb by General Mutengah,
chief of the Manchu garrison at Nanking. Two tablets of
stone, bearing his name, shall be erected, one at Nanking in
the Temple of the Loyal and the Illustrious, the other in
Pekin in the Pantheon of the Wise and Good.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
A taÃ«l is worth about five shillings.</p></div>

<p>"I wish the life of K'wo-Fan to be written and given into
the care of the Imperial historiographers, that the memory
of a life so beautiful may be preserved in the national
annals. His son will inherit the title of count, and I give
him dispensation from an audience.</p>

<p>"I appoint Ho-Ching, lieutenant-general of Kiang-Su, to
be instructor of the children and grand-children of the
deceased. A token of my munificence will be given to them,
that they may know how my throne remembers and honours
a loyal servant.</p>

<p class="tdc">
"Let this edict be respected!"<br />
</p>

<p>The homage rendered to heroes, wise men, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
philanthropists, has its origin in the religious principles
inculcated by Chinese philosophers. These
philosophers were very numerous in China in past
days, and it is only possible to give an account here
of the most celebrated of them.</p>

<p>Some twenty-three centuries before the Christian
era the Chinese simply worshipped one Supreme
Being, first under the vague name of Thian, or
Heaven; later under the more personal title of Ti
Shang, or the Great One.</p>

<p>Gradually, however, this monotheism was succeeded
by the deification of the heavenly bodies,
each with a priest of its own, whose business it was
to advise those responsible for the government of
China. These priests, who became in course of time
extremely powerful, won their influence through
the study of astronomy; but as that influence
sometimes ran counter to the wishes of the
emperors and bid fair to supersede their power,
they eventually suppressed the entire hierarchy. In
Europe this interference with the spiritual guides
of the people would have aroused a passion of
fanaticism, and have resulted in massacres and
religious wars, but nothing of the kind occurred in
China, for there the martyr's palm and crown are
never coveted, and religious zeal never produces
the terrible results with which the student of
European history is familiar. Truly, the Celestials
are to be congratulated on the calmness with which
they accept what they consider the inevitable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A WISE EMPEROR</div>

<p>The following characteristic epitome of the
religious ideas in vogue amongst the Chinese in
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 1760, is taken from a proclamation issued
to his people by the Emperor then on the
throne:</p>

<p>"Shang-Ti, the supreme ruler, has given reason
to man, and if he listens to its dictates his spirit
will exist for ever, but if he does not he will revert
to nothingness."</p>

<p>"The ruler of Hia," continues this old-world
proclamation, "extinguished in his soul the light
of reason, and inflicted a thousand ills upon the
people in all the States of the Empire. Oppressed
and unable longer to endure such tyranny, the
people made known to the spirits of high and low
degree, that they were unjustly dealt with. The
eternal reason of Heaven gives happiness to the
virtuous, and misery to the vicious and depraved,
and this is why Heaven has visited Hia with all
manner of calamities to make his crimes manifest
to all.</p>

<p>"As a result of this, all unworthy though I be, I
have felt it my duty to conform to the unmistakable
and terrible decrees of Heaven. I dared not
leave such great crimes unpunished, but I did dare
to take a black bullock to serve as the sacrifice I
felt bound to offer. I ventured to appeal to the
august Heaven and to the divine ruler of the earth....
To each of you I have assigned the States he
is to govern. Beware of obeying unjust laws or
adopting unjust customs. Do not fall into the
mistakes which result from idleness, nor yield to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
love of pleasure. By observing and obeying wise
and equitable laws, you will be following the commands
of Heaven.... All is sifted in the heart
of Shang-Ti. The crimes any or all of you commit
will be visited on me alone, but if I do evil you
will have no part in it."</p>

<p>In this quaint address is shadowed forth the
beautiful idea that the Emperor is responsible to
God for his people, though they are not responsible
for him. A similar thought is apparent in the
following quotation from a kind of penitential
psalm which the same Emperor is said to have
composed on the occasion of a famine which decimated
China during his reign. Feeling that he
must have done something to arouse the wrath of
Heaven, he cut off the long hair and nails which
are the special pride of highly-born Celestials, and
laying aside his Imperial robes, wrapped himself
in the skins of beasts. Thus disguised he went
forth alone to a mountain and vented his grief and
remorse for having:</p>

<p>1. Neglected to instruct his subjects as he ought
to have done.</p>

<p>2. For failing to win them back to their duty
when they had departed from it.</p>

<p>3. For having built grand palaces, and incurred
other expenses by unnecessary building.</p>

<p>4. For having too many wives, and loving them
too much.</p>

<p>5. For caring too much for the delicacies of the
table.</p>

<p>6. And lastly, for having lent too ready an ear
to the flattery of his favourites, and of certain high
officials of his court.</p>

<p>Another significant and noteworthy fact brought
out alike in the proclamation and confession of
this enlightened ruler is, that there is no idea of
any intermediary being necessary between him
and God. It is the same to this day, no priest
intervenes between the Emperor and Shang-Ti,
and the bonzes who spend their lives studying the
moral precepts of Lao-Tsze and Confucius are
merely thinkers who never interfere in affairs of
State or with the religious teaching of the people.
Hence the total indifference of the Chinese to
matters of faith; they believe in free-will, and act
in accordance with that belief.</p>

<p>In the sixth and seventh centuries before our
era the Chinese Empire was in a condition little
short of anarchy. The wealthy were depraved,
the poor were steeped in misery, and everywhere
injustice and oppression were the rule. The
emperors frittered away their lives in their harems,
giving no thought to the welfare of their people.
It was time indeed for a reformer to arise, and the
first to appear was the great Lao-Tsze, who is
supposed to have been born about 604 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, fifty
years before the yet greater Kung-Fu-tze, or, as he
is called by Europeans, Confucius.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LIFE OF LAO-TSZE</div>

<p>The state of the Celestial Empire when Lao-Tsze
first began to inculcate his peculiar doctrines
was corrupt in the extreme, greatly resembling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
that of the Roman Empire in the time of Nero,
when the disciples of Christ preached equality and
contempt for riches, striving to win souls from the
awful depravity and sensuality of the heathen
world, and to teach them to aspire to an ideal
and divine love and to the immaterial joys of
the Christian heaven. Lao-Tsze, who was to inaugurate
the great reform completed later by
Confucius, began his public career as curator of
the library of the King of the Tcheou, in what
was then the city of Lob, not far from that of Lob-yang
in the present province of Honan. His real
name is supposed to have been Erh-Li, but that
of Lao-Tsze, signifying the old philosopher, has
entirely superseded it. Whilst keeper of the royal
books he is said to have read many of the works
of Indian philosophers, and from them to have
imbibed the principles embodied in his own immortal
work, called the <i>Tao-Teh-King</i>, the exact
meaning of the title of which has been so much
discussed, but is generally translated the "Book of
Supreme reason and virtue." If, as may well be,
the word <i>Tao</i> is identical with the Greek &#920;&#949;&#959;&#962; and
with the Latin <i>Deos</i>, both of which mean God,
then the proper rendering of <i>Tao-Teh-King</i> is the
"Book of God and of reason." However that may
be, it is certain that its author was a true theist,
rightly considered the founder of Theism, which
is one of the three doctrines held in equal honour
by the Celestials, the other two being Confucianism
and Buddhism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Many legends have gathered about the memory
of Lao-Tsze, and the young Confucius is said to
have met the old philosopher more than once.
The former is reported to have said after an
interview in Pekin with his forerunner: "To-day I
have seen Lao-Tsze, and can only liken him to a
dragon who mounts aloft in the clouds, I cannot
tell how, and rises to heaven." Another story is
that the older Chinese philosopher travelled in
India and there met Pythagoras, the great mathematician
and believer in the transmigration of
souls; but if so, there is no trace of the influence
of the Greek in the <i>Tao-Teh-King</i>, which must have
been written before its author left China. As a
matter of fact, very little is really known of the life
of Lao-Tsze, but some idea of his peculiar views
can be obtained from the following quotations
from his book:</p>

<p>"God," he says, "is spiritual and material, so
that He has two kinds of existence. We emanate
in the first instance from the former or spiritual
nature, to enter later into the second. Our aim
upon earth should be to return to the first, or
spiritual nature. To succeed in this we must
refrain from the pleasures of the world, control our
passions, and practise boundless charity."</p>

<p>It is the advocacy of this boundless charity
which justifies us in comparing the doctrine of Lao-Tsze
with primitive Christianity. Before, however,
we give proofs of this affinity it will be interesting
to note how the old philosopher proves his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
assertion, that all the material forms of nature are
but emanations from the divine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE <i>TAO-TEH-KING</i></div>

<p>In the twenty-fifth section of the <i>Tao-Teh-King</i>
we read:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>"Beings of corporeal form were made from matter which
was at first in a chaotic condition.</p>

<p>"Before the heaven and the earth came into being,
there was nothing but a profound silence, a boundless void,
without any perceptible form.</p>

<p>"It<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> existed alone, infinite, immutable.</p>

<p>"It moved about in the illimitable space without undergoing
any change.</p>

<p>"It may be looked upon as the mother of the Universe.</p>

<p>"I am ignorant of its name, but I call it the Tao, by
which I mean supreme and universal Reason.</p>

<p>"Constrained to make a name for it, I designate it by its
attributes, and call it grand, lofty.</p>

<p>"Having recognized that it is grand and lofty, I add
that it is all-embracing.</p>

<p>"Having recognized that it is infinite, I designate it as
unlike myself....</p>

<p>"The earth is ruled by Heaven.</p>

<p>"Heaven is ruled by the Tao or universal Reason.</p>

<p>"Universal Reason is a law unto itself"</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Lao-Tsze speaks of the Supreme Being as "it," not "he," and implies
that his Tao, whatever he signified by it, may have existed even before
God.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trans.</span></p></div>

<p>These quotations cannot fail to give an exalted
idea of the principles advocated by the Chinese
sage. They even shadow forth, to some extent,
the doctrine of the Gospel, which was not preached
until 600 years after the death of the author of
the <i>Tao-Teh-King</i>; but the extract I give now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
from the forty-ninth section of the book on Supreme
Reason is yet more strikingly significant:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>"The heart of a holy man is not inexorable.</p>

<p>"His heart is in sympathy with the hearts of all other
men.</p>

<p>"A virtuous man should be treated according to his
virtue.</p>

<p>"A vicious man should be treated as if he also were
virtuous. Herein is wisdom and virtue."</p></div>

<p>Again in the sixteenth section we read:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>"To be just, and equitable to all, is to have the attributes
of God.</p>

<p>"Having the attributes of God is to be of the divine
nature.</p>

<p>"To be of the divine nature is to succeed in becoming
identified with the Tao or the supreme and universal
Reason.</p>

<p>"To be identified with the supreme Reason is to win
eternal life.</p>

<p>"Even when the body is put to death, there is no need
to have any fear of annihilation."</p></div>

<p>So much for Lao-Tsze's belief in the immortality
of the soul; now note in what touching terms he
expresses his compassion for the unhappy and
unfortunate:</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>"If the people suffer from hunger, it is because they are
weighed down by taxes too heavy for them.</p>

<p>"This is the cause of their misery. . . .</p>

<p>"If the people are difficult to govern, it is because they
are oppressed by work too hard for them. . . .</p>

<p>"This is the cause of their insubordination.</p>

<p>"If the people are indifferent to the approach of death,
it is because they find it too difficult to obtain sufficient
nourishment.</p>

<p>"That is why they die with so little regret."</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Under</span> the continued influence of Lao-Tsze,
China would probably have become in course of
time crowded with monasteries, in which numerous
bonzes would have devoted their lives to sterile
contemplation, which would have profited their
country not at all. Fortunately, however, the old
philosopher was succeeded by the more practical
Confucius, who made China what he meant it to
be during his life-time, enforcing respect for tradition
with the strict observance of the worship of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
ancestors. Devoted to agriculture, he did much to
promote its scientific practice; an inexorable lover
of justice, he had no mercy on the abuses and
peculations of the mandarins. He knew how to
turn to account every incident which could redound
to his fame, and about his name gathered many
romantic legends such as serve to fix on their hero
the love and admiration of the populace. In this
he differed, as did all the other great leaders of
thought in the East, from Lao-Tsze, who owed his
celebrity to the culte of pure reason alone, a
doctrine too abstract for the apprehension of the
general public, who ever delight in the marvellous.
The earlier philosopher appeared and disappeared
with absolutely no <i>Ã©clat</i>, and his most ardent
admirers never associated his birth or death with
anything supernatural. It was far otherwise with
Buddha, Confucius, Mahomet, and our Saviour,
who one and all were credited with the power of
working miracles, though those of Christ alone
have been authenticated.</p>

<p>It could only detract from the real glory of
Confucius to dwell on the many extraordinary
phenomena which are said by his disciples to have
accompanied his entrance into the world. The
great Chinese dragon called <i>Kilin</i>, who never
comes down to earth from his home in heaven
except to foretell marvellous events, failed not to
appear in the garden of the house of the future
hero's father, where he vomited forth a stone of
jade bearing the following inscription:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"A child as pure as the crystalline wave will be
born when the dynasty of Tcheu is in its decline;
he will be king, but without any kingdom."</p>

<div class="sidenote">BIRTH OF CONFUCIUS</div>

<p>According to the most trustworthy accounts
Confucius was born in the village of Ch'ieh in the
present province of Shantung in <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 551. The
only child of his parents, he lost his father when
he was but three years old, and was brought up by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
his mother, who was left with very little money.
To quote the philosopher's own words, he could
from the first "do whatever his heart prompted,
and his mind was set on learning from the age of
fifteen."</p>

<p>Before he was twenty he had attracted the
general attention of his neighbours through the
skill with which he rendered fertile districts which
had long been considered barren. He was equally
successful in the breeding of flocks, and the land
under his care supported thousands of animals, so
that the farmers who before could scarcely eke out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
a miserable subsistence, now found themselves rich
and well-to-do.</p>

<p>On the death of his mother he had her body
transported to the
grave of his father,
saying: "Those
who were united
in life should not
be separated after
death." The two
were therefore
buried together
with their heads
towards the north
and their feet towards
the south.
The remains were
protected from
wild beasts by
being placed in
strongly constructed
wooden
coffins, made of
planks four inches
thick and smeared
with oil and varnish.
To ensure
their preservation as long as possible mounds of earth
forming regular little hills were piled up above them.</p>

<p>During the three years of mourning which
succeeded his sad loss, when, according to a custom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
still observed, he could do no public work, Confucius
devoted himself to the study of ancient
usage in everything connected with the death of a
father or a mother.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BURIAL CUSTOMS IN CHINA</div>

<p>During a long sojourn in the Philippine Islands,
which have recently been so very much before
the public in consequence of the results of the war
between America and Spain, I was surprised to
notice that the cemeteries were as a rule situated
in the most barren and uncultivated districts.
Once a year plates of rice were brought and
placed upon the graves by the relatives of those
interred in them. When I arrived in China, however,
I found the same peculiarity the fashion
there, and the last resting-places of the dead who
had once resided in Canton, Macao, and other
large Chinese towns were far away from the haunts
of the living. The reason was explained by the
sentence quoted below from the books of the great
philosopher which is translated from Father Amiot's
version.</p>

<p>It appears that some agents of Confucius had
been sent by him to survey certain districts in the
kingdom of Lu, and on their return they reported
to him that wealthy inhabitants were in the habit
of erecting sepulchres on lands which might be
made very fertile.</p>

<p>"That is a strange abuse," cried Confucius, "and
one which I mean to remedy. Burial-places should
not resemble gardens of pleasure and amusement,
they should be the scene of sobs and tears; it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
thus that they were regarded by the ancients. To
enjoy magnificent and sumptuous repasts where
everything is suggestive of luxury and joy, near
the tombs containing the bones of those to whom
we owe our lives, is a kind of insult to the dead.
These tombs must no longer be surrounded by
walls, they must no longer be encircled by trees
symmetrically
planted. When
deprived of all
these frivolous
ornaments, the
homage which
all will hasten to
pay to those who
have ceased to
live will be sincere
and pure.
If, then, we desire
to perform
funeral rites in
the spirit of their
first founders we must remain true to the traditions
of the sages of the remote past."</p>

<img src="images/fig28.png" width="277" height="289" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">FIG. 28.&mdash;A CHINESE CEMETERY.</div>
</div>

<p>For the twenty-three centuries which have
elapsed since this protest was written, Chinese
sepulchres have always been placed on high ground
of a dreary, desolate aspect, with nothing to mark
them but a plain unsculptured slab of stone.</p>

<p>Philosophers very seldom become real friends,
and the more they are thrown together the less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
cordial become their relations. The story goes that
Confucius as a young man went to pay his respects
to Lao-Tsze, but that the latter gave his visitor very
haughtily to understand that he considered him
wanting in humility, by which he probably meant
that Confucius was too much occupied with the
things of this world, and not enough with those of
heaven. The fact is, that the younger reformer
was interested in everything that was going on
wherever he happened to be, and was ready to talk
to everybody. For all that, however, he studied
the most abstruse psychological problems, and I do
not suppose that even Lao-Tsze himself could have
made a better answer than Confucius did to the
King of Lu when he asked the difficult question
quoted below.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE KING OF LU</div>

<p>It must be remembered that in the time of
Confucius, China was divided into little kingdoms,
all of which the sage, who was fond of travelling,
visited in turn. When he arrived at Lu, the king,
who was already an old man, received him at once,
and is reported to have thus addressed him:</p>

<p>"I have been expecting you with impatience, for
I want you to explain certain things to me about
nature and man. Man, our sages tell us, is
distinguished from all other visible beings by the
intellectual faculty which renders him capable of
reasoning, and all our wise men agree in adding
that man derives this valuable faculty direct from
Heaven. Now is it not true that we derive our
whole nature from our parents, even as other beings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
are reproduced by generation? I entreat you to
enlighten me on this point."</p>

<p>"It is not easy," replied Confucius, "to explain
clearly to you a matter of which so little is really
known. To obey you, however, I will give you in
a few words a <i>rÃ©sumÃ©</i> of all I know on the subject,
and your own penetration will find out the rest.</p>

<p>"A portion of the substance of the father and
the mother placed in the organ formed for its
reception is the cause of our existence and the
germ of our being. This germ would, however,
remain inert and dead without the help of the two
contrary principles of the Yang and the Yin.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>&mdash;These
two universal agents of nature, which are in all
things and everywhere, act reciprocally on it, developing
it, insensibly extending and continuing it,
and causing it to assume definite form.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> "In the order of living beings," says M. G. Pauthier, in the section
on China of <i>L'Univers Pittoresque</i>, "the Yang and the Yin are the male
and female principles; in the order of the elements they are the luminous
and the dark principles; in the order of natural substances the strong and
the weak principles."</p></div>

<p>"The germ has now become a living being, but
this living being is not yet promoted to the dignity
of a man; it does not become one until it is united
with that intellectual substance which Heaven
bestows on it to enable it to understand, to compare,
and to judge. So long as this being, thus animated
and endowed with intelligence, continues to combine
the two principles necessary to the development,
extension, the growth and the perfection of its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
form, it will enjoy life; it ceases to live as soon as
these two principles cease to combine. It does
not attain to the fulness of life except by degrees,
and by means of expansion; in the same way
it is only finally destroyed by gradual decay.
Its destruction is not, however, destruction properly
so called, it is a decomposition into its original
elements; the intellectual substance returns to
the heaven whence it came; the animal breath,
or the <i>Khi</i>, becomes united with the aÃ«rial fluid,
whilst the earthly and liquid substances become
once more earth and water.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE NATURE OF MAN</div>

<p>"Man, say our ancient sages, is a unique being,
in whom are united the attributes of all other beings.
He is endowed with intelligence, with the power of
attaining perfection, with liberty, and with social
qualities; he is able to discriminate, to compare, to
work for a definite aim, and to take the necessary
measures for the attainment of that aim. He may
become perfect or depraved according to the good
or evil use he makes of his liberty; he is
acquainted alike with virtue and vice, and feels that
he has duties to perform towards Heaven, himself,
and his fellow-men. If he acquit himself of these
various duties, he is virtuous and worthy of
recompense; he is culpable and merits punishment
if he neglects them. This is a very short <i>rÃ©sumÃ©</i>
of all I can tell you of the nature of man."</p>

<p>The King of Lu, it is said, was delighted with
this reply, as how could he fail to be? Some years
later the monarch made his sage adviser prime
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
minister of his realm, and the philosopher remained
in power for three years, administering justice so
rigorously that, says one of his biographers, "if
gold or jewels were dropped on the highway they
would remain untouched until the rightful owner
appeared to claim them." The story goes that
under Confucius, Lu became so prosperous as to
arouse the jealousy of the neighbouring King of
Tse, who, with a wonderful insight into human
nature, sent not an army, but a troop of beautiful
dancing-girls to the court of the rival monarch.
The man&#339;uvre was successful; the King of Lu
neglected the affairs of state to watch the posturing
of the sirens, and Confucius fell into disgrace.
When he proudly told his sovereign to choose
between him and the dancers, the old king promptly
replied that he preferred the latter; so Confucius
went forth with his followers to seek his fortunes
elsewhere.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONFUCIUS ON THE ARTS</div>

<p>Many are the anecdotes told of the wanderings
of the sage after this tragic end to his work of
reformation in his native state. In some districts
he was gladly welcomed; in others he was often in
danger of his life. At the court of Yen, where
the king questioned him much as the monarch
of Lu had done, he held forth less on abstruse
doctrine than on education. "Young men," he is
reported to have said, "should travel and become
acquainted with many lands, so as to be able to
judge the customs of different nations, and the
peculiar characteristics of various races. I am so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
penetrated by this truth," he added, "that I will
not fail to put it in practice whenever I get the
opportunity. I would recommend the exercises of
the gymnasium to all adolescents, and the study
of what are called the liberal arts: Music, civil
and religious ceremonial, arithmetic, fencing, and
the art (<i>sic</i>) of managing skilfully a carriage of
any kind drawn by horses or oxen." To his son,
who asked him if he ought to devote himself to
poetry, he replied: "You will never know how to
speak or write well unless you make verses."</p>

<p>One day he met a party of hunters, and, to the
great surprise of his own followers, he asked to be
allowed to join them, explaining that the first inhabitants
of the earth lived by the chase alone, and
adding that the reason he wished to be a hunter
was to impress upon those about him once more
how great a respect he had for the traditions of
olden times.</p>

<p>He learnt music when very young, and found in
it a rest and recreation after his arduous and varied
avocations. He became, it is said, so wonderfully
skilful in the art of music, that when he had once
heard the work of a composer, he could draw a
faithful portrait of him, bringing out alike his
physical and moral characteristics, which was
indeed going to the very root of the matter. As
for me, I do not think it is by any means necessary
to be able to perform on an instrument in order
to form a very good idea of the character of such
composers as Rossini, Berlioz, and Wagner, after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
hearing <i>Il Barbiere di Siviglia</i>, <i>Les Troyens</i>, or
<i>Die Meistersinger</i>; but as for giving portraits of
their personal appearance, that would truly be
difficult!</p>

<p>Confucius, who took to himself a wife at the
age of nineteen, was in favour of early marriages,
and placed the limit of age for a woman at twenty,
and for a man at thirty. He founded his arguments
on the fact that in China a boy is considered
to have become a man directly he enters
his twentieth year, and that as soon as a girl is
fifteen the management of the house is entrusted
to her during the winter, whilst in the spring, when
ploughing begins, she is sent to look after the mulberry
trees. At the respective ages of twenty and
fifteen, a boy and girl may become the head of a
family, "if," discreetly adds the sage, "the parents
give permission."</p>

<div class="sidenote">MEANING OF THE PH&#338;NIX</div>

<p>I take a real pleasure in recalling the kindly
sayings of this old-world sage, who, it must be
remembered, lived 600 years before the birth of
our Lord, a fact which ought to silence those who
are accustomed to speak flippantly of the barbarism
of past centuries. Moreover, the laws and
customs advocated by Confucius had really been
in force, in what was then called the "Middle State,"
for no less than 2500 years before the Christian
era, but they had fallen into abeyance. The great
philosopher was not so much an innovator as a
restorer, for so lofty was the morality of the
ancient laws that the Chinese people never dreamt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of modifying them. Hence the extraordinary immobility
of the manners and customs of the
Orient, which contrasts so forcibly with the constant
eagerness in the West for meaningless novelties.
To give an account of the doctrines of Confucius is
really to revive the traditions of the remote past,
for which the Celestials have so deep a reverence.
To give but one case in point: noticing that all
mandarins have a ph&#339;nix with outspread wings
embroidered on their robes, I inquired what it
meant, and learnt to my astonishment that in the
year 500 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> an Emperor had ordered this
design to be worn by his chief officers on their
breasts. The fabulous ph&#339;nix, the herald of good
fortune so often seen in China, had appeared to
this Emperor on his ascent to the throne; a sure
symbol in the eyes of the Chinese of a prosperous
reign, and the conservative Mandarins have kept
up the custom of wearing a representation of the
bird with outstretched wings ever since.</p>

<p>For the benefit of those who do not rightly
reverence antiquity, I will quote a speech on the
subject of marriage, addressed by Confucius to
the King of Lu before the great philosopher was
exiled from the kingdom he had ruled over so
wisely.</p>

<p>"Marriage," said the sage, "is the right state for
man, because it is only through marriage that he
can fulfil his destiny upon earth; there is therefore
nothing more honourable, nothing more worthy
of his serious consideration than his power of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
fulfilling exactly all duties. Amongst these are
some shared in common by both sexes, others
which are to be performed by each sex in particular.
The man is the head, it is for him to command;
the woman is subject to him, it is for her to obey.
It is the function of both together to imitate those
operations of the heaven
and the earth which combine
in the production, the
support, and the preservation
of all things. Reciprocal
tenderness, mutual
confidence, truthfulness and
respect, should form the
foundation of their conduct;
instruction and direction on
the part of the husband,
docility and complaisance
on the part of the woman,
in everything which does
not interfere with the requirements
of justice, propriety,
and honour.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">FIG. 29.&mdash;A YOUNG CHINESE MARRIED LADY.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">CHINESE WIDOWS</div>

<p>"As society is now constituted, the woman owes
all that she is to her husband. If death takes him
from her, it does not make her her own mistress.
As a daughter, she was under the authority of her
father and mother, or failing them of the brothers
older than herself; as a wife she was ruled by her
husband as long as he lived; as a widow she is
under the surveillance of her son, or if she has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
several sons, of the eldest of them, and this son,
whilst ministering to her with all possible affection
and respect, will shield her from all the dangers
to which the weakness of her sex might expose
her. Custom does not permit second marriage to
a widow, but prescribes on the contrary that she
should seclude herself within the precincts of her
own house, and never leave it again all the rest of
her life. She is forbidden to attend to any business,
no matter what, outside her home. As a result
she ought not to understand any such business;
she will not even meddle in domestic matters
unless compelled to do so by necessity, that is to
say, whilst her children are still young. During the
day she should avoid showing herself, by refraining
from going from room to room, unless obliged to
do so. And during the night the room in which
she sleeps should always be lit up. Only by
leading a retired life such as this will she win
amongst her descendants the glory of having
fulfilled the duties of a virtuous woman."</p>

<p>It would indeed be difficult for a widow to live
up to such an ideal as this, and that the Chinese
themselves realize the fact, is proved by their
raising monuments to the memory of those who
succeed.</p>

<p>"I have already said," adds Confucius, "that
between fifteen and twenty is the age at which a
girl should change her state by marriage. As on
this change of state depends the happiness or
misery in which she will pass the rest of her days,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
nothing should be neglected to procure for her a
proper establishment, and the most advantageous
one permitted by circumstances. Special care
should be taken not to allow her to enter a family
which has taken part in any conspiracy against
the State, or in any open revolt, or into one whose
affairs are in disorder, or which is agitated by
internal dissensions. She should not have a
husband chosen for her who has been publicly
dishonoured by any crime bringing him under the
notice of the law; to a man suffering from any
chronic complaint, any mental eccentricity, any
bodily deformity, such as would make it difficult
to get on with him, or render him repulsive or
disagreeable, or to a man who is the eldest of a
family but has neither father nor mother. With
the exception of these five classes of men, a husband
may be chosen for her from any rank of society,
with whom it will depend on herself alone whether
she passes her life happily or not. She has but to
fulfil exactly all the duties of her new state to
enjoy the portion of bliss destined for her."</p>

<p>It is the parents who decide who their children
shall marry, and a young Chinaman does not
know his <i>fiancÃ©e</i> until the day of his wedding.
This explains why Confucius thought it necessary
to go into all these details on the subject of suitable
husbands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">REASONS FOR DIVORCE</div>

<p>"A husband," he adds, "has the right to put
away his wife, but he must not use this right in an
arbitrary manner; he must have some legitimate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
cause for enforcing it. The legitimate causes of
repudiation reduce themselves to seven: The first
when a woman cannot live in harmony with her
father- or mother-in-law; the second, if she is
unable to perpetuate the race because of her
recognized sterility; the third, if she be justly
suspected of having violated conjugal fidelity, or
if she gives any proof of unchastity; the fourth, if
she bring trouble into her home by calumnious
or indiscreet reports; the fifth, if she have; any
infirmity such as every man would naturally shrink
from; the sixth, if it is difficult to correct her of
the use of intemperate language; the seventh, if
unknown to her husband she steals anything
secretly in the house, no matter from what motive.</p>

<p>"Although any one of these reasons is sufficient
to authorize a husband to put away his wife, there
are three circumstances which forbid him to use
his right: the first, when his wife has neither father
nor mother, and would have nowhere to go to;
the second, when she is in mourning for her father-
or mother-in-law, for three years after the death of
either of them; the third, when her husband, having
been poor when he married her, has subsequently
become rich."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Truly there is much wisdom in the counsels of
Confucius on the vexed subject of marriage, but it
is impossible to help feeling that the very low view
he took of the position of women detracts greatly
from the merit of the discourse quoted above. We
are, in fact, inclined to endorse the opinion of the
missionary Gutzlaff, who, speaking of the revered
sage, remarks: "By not giving a proper rank in
society to females, by denying to them the privileges
which are their due as sisters, mothers, wives, and
daughters ... he has marred the harmony of social
life, and put a barrier against the improvement of
society. The regeneration of China will, in fact,
never take place, unless the females be raised from
the degraded state which Confucius assigned to
them."</p>

<div class="sidenote">SUICIDE</div>

<p>On yet another exciting topic, that of suicide, it
will perhaps be salutary to relate one anecdote
illustrating the view the reformer took of the
matter, now that so many despairing souls have
lost the aids and consolations of religious faith in
struggling with the difficulties of their life on earth;
when followers of the stoical and heroic Zeno are
becoming rarer and rarer, and so many young men
and women resort to the fumes of charcoal, or to
the waters of the nearest river, to put an end to
the woes they have not the courage to face. We
must premise, however, that there is really far more
excuse for an Asiatic to take his own life than
for a European, there being nothing unreasonable
about it according to the doctrine of Buddha, whose
disciples believe firmly in the transmigration of
souls. They do not, it is true, profess to know
whether, if they commit suicide they will become
animals, but they are firmly convinced that they
will continue to live, whereas the atheist has faith
in nothingness alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<div class="fig_caption">FIG. 31.&mdash;A DESPERATE MAN.</div>
</div>

<p>In one of his many journeys Confucius and his
disciples met a man who was trying to strangle
himself with a rope. When asked what his motives
were for wishing to commit suicide, he replied that
he had been a bad son, a bad father, and a bad
citizen. The remorse he felt for the terrible
character his self-examination revealed him to be
from all these three points
of view, had made his
life odious to him, and he
had come out to a lonely
place to put an end to it.</p>

<p>Greatly shocked, Confucius
reproved him, addressing
him in the following
terms: "However
great the crimes you have
committed, the worst of
all of them is yielding to
despair. All the others
may be allowed, but that
is irremediable. You
have, no doubt, gone
astray from the very first steps you took upon
earth. You should have begun by being a man
of ordinary worth before attempting to distinguish
yourself You cannot attain to being an
eminent person until you have strictly fulfilled
the duty imposed by nature on every human
creature. You ought to have begun by being a
good son; to love and serve those to whom you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
owed your being was the most essential of your
obligations; you neglected to do so, and from that
negligence have resulted all your misfortunes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SPEECH OF CONFUCIUS</div>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 306px;"><a id="Fig_32"></a><br />

<div class="fig_caption">FIG. 32.&mdash;THE TOMB OF CONFUCIUS.<br />

(<i>Univers Pittoresque.</i>)</div>
</div>

<p>"Do not, however, suppose that all is lost; take
courage again, and try to become convinced of a
truth which all past centuries have proved to be
incontestable. This is the truth I refer to; treasure
it up in your mind, and never lose hold of it: <i>As long
as a man has life, there is no reason to despair of him;</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
he may pass suddenly from the greatest trouble
to the greatest joy, from the greatest misfortune to
the greatest felicity. Take courage once more,
return home, and strive to turn to account every
instant, as if you began to-day for the first time to
realize the value of life."</p>

<p>Then turning to the younger of his disciples,
Confucius said to them: "What you have heard
from the lips of this man is an excellent lesson for
you&mdash;reflect seriously upon it, every one of you."</p>

<p>After this remonstrance it is said that thirteen
of the followers of the sage left him to return home
and perform their filial duties. The Celestials, in
fact, all agree in saying that filial piety was alike
the groundwork of the Confucian philosophy and
the foundation of Chinese society. In spite of
much that is strange to European ideas, might
we not well follow many of the precepts of the
enlightened pre-Christian teacher?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I had</span> confided to M. Vaucher, that most amiable
of cicerones whom I had been fortunate enough to
meet at Canton, my great wish to go to Macao
and make a pilgrimage to the grotto where it is
said Camoens, the great Portuguese poet, wrote a
portion of his most important work, the <i>Lusiads</i>.
M. Vaucher at once made arrangements for me to
go to the celebrated Portuguese settlement by river
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
and sea, and placed one of his own decked boats
at my disposal. He even went so far as to choose
a crew for me, and to arm that crew with six rifles.
Before I started he warned me to keep in my
cabin so as not to arouse the cupidity of the
banditti, who abound on the river, by appearing
on deck.</p>

<p>"If," he said to me, "my men point out to you
a suspicious-looking craft, be on your guard against
it. You may easily," he added, "recognize pirate
boats for yourself, for this reason, they always
prowl about in groups of three, so that each may
help the others in case of bad weather or any
difficulty; a clever arrangement greatly facilitating
their evil designs, for the crews are rapidly
transformed from harmless fishermen to fierce
pirates should occasion serve for doing a stroke of
business."</p>

<p>In spite of these ominous warnings, however, my
voyage passed over without incident, and I arrived
safely at the port of Macao, situated on the southern
extremity of a small peninsula of the island of
Hiang-shang and separated from the Chinese
province of Canton merely by a wall, which is in
as ruinous a condition as is the more celebrated
Great Wall of Tartary. As we approached Macao
a beautiful scene was spread out before us, wooded
hills dotted with charming villas, in which the
wealthy English of Hong-Kong spend much of the
summer, and groups of picturesque rocks rising
from the curving shores of the lovely bay with its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
stretch of gleaming white sand, to which the Portuguese,
to whom Macao was ceded by the Chinese,
have given the appropriate name of the <i>Porto de
Praya grande</i>.</p>

<p>Here swarms the teeming amphibious fishing
population of Macao, and from this perfect bow
with its picturesque surroundings were shipped,
alas! for all too many years, thousands of coolies
for the labour market of Havana and Peru, who
were many of them embarked under terribly tragic
circumstances.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EMIGRATION AGENTS</div>

<p>A true Celestial is in fact a born gambler, and
indulges his instincts to such an extent that when
he has lost fortune, wife, and daughters he finally
stakes himself! This fact is well known to the
emigration agents not only of Macao, but of the
other Chinese ports, where numbers were formerly
enrolled for service in Peru, Chili, the Philippine
Islands, and various places in Oceania with very
little, if any, volition on their own part. Emigration
agents used to lie in wait for Chinese loungers,
and accost those who looked fairly robust politely,
take them to the flower-boats and other public
resorts where opium was smoked, and if their luckless
victims still had any money left, their insinuating
tempters would entice them into some low
gambling hell, where, after a few throws of the
dice, the ruin of the simple, confiding fellows was
complete. Then when the unfortunate Celestials
had emptied their purses, and their brains were
muddled with opium or from the effects of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
debauchery, their dim eyes were dazzled by the
offer of a few piastres, and in exchange for a
trifling sum they signed away their liberty. When
they came to their senses they found they had
bound themselves to leave their country.</p>

<p>The agents were careful when they got the poor
fellows' signatures not to let out how far from
China were the sugar-cane plantations of the
Antilles or the guano isles of Peru. Their victims
had only learnt one fact thoroughly, and that was
that their country is the centre of the universe,
the foreign nations surrounding it being looked
upon as its tributaries. If the emigrants asked
where they were going, they were told to some
place very near the port of embarkation. This
wicked deception was really the cause of the
terrible massacres of coolies to which many captains
of emigrant vessels were driven to save their ships
and crews. When after a few days' voyage a
vessel had to touch at some port for any reason,
and the poor coolies packed away below the hatchways
saw above the barriers or through the portholes,
the bright verdure of an island of Oceania,
or the distant blue mountains of the American
continent, they at once jumped to the conclusion
that their journey was at an end, and were wild to
leave the vessel, no matter at what cost. Some
even in mid-ocean, out of sight of land, became so
heart-broken from home-sickness that they quietly
packed up the few things belonging to them and
jumped into the sea with them. Now and then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
a few of these would-be suicides were fished out
again by order of the captain, and would calmly
explain their action by some such speech as this:
"We want to go back to our own country."
Truly those who believe in metempsychosis cherish
wonderful delusions!</p>

<p>On one occasion in the roadstead of Manila a
swarm of coolies who thought they had arrived
at Havana mutinied because the captain would
not allow them to land. The crew of the vessel
drove them back between decks at the point of the
sword, and they all perished from suffocation in a
few hours for want of air.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A TERRIBLE CATASTROPHE</div>

<p>Mutiny on their part was not, however, the only
reason which sometimes led to the sacrifice of a
whole cargo of Asiatics. It was all too often a
case of might makes right, and when some convulsion
of the elements rendered it imperative to
lighten a vessel, many a captain easily persuaded
himself that he had no choice but to save his crew
by the sacrifice of his human freight. This was
the cause of the awful catastrophe off the Paracelses
reefs in the China Sea, which have as sinister a
reputation as the Goodwin Sands of the English
coast, or the Baie des TrÃ©passÃ©s of that of Brittany.
An unskilful captain had run his vessel on to the
far-famed reefs during the night, and seeing that
it was hopeless to attempt to save the five hundred
coolies he was to have taken to Peru, he called his
crew together and told them to lower all the boats
as quietly as possible. This was done, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
captain saved himself and his sailors, leaving the five
hundred Celestials to their fate. The unfortunate
coolies, roused from their sleep by the bumping of
the vessel against the rocks, uttered piercing screams
for help from the narrow space in which they were
confined, but we need scarcely add that the cautious
captain had most likely had the hatchways securely
nailed down by his carpenter before he left the ship.</p>

<p>When there is not much sea on, the Paracelses
reefs can be clearly seen, certain flat portions
emerging here and there for a few inches above
the surface of the water. If there were never such
a thing as a storm, and no danger of the islets
being swept by the waves, it would be possible to
live on them and even to support life by feeding on
the turtles and shell-fish abounding there; so that
if the poor abandoned coolies had been able to
get out of their prison, who can tell but what they
might have saved themselves by clinging to the
rocks till help arrived? As it was, however, not
a single emigrant was ever seen again. On the
arrival safe and sound at Hong-Kong of the captain
and his crew, the English authorities at once sent
the fleetest steamer in the port to the scene of the
shipwreck, but those on that steamer saw nothing
of the lost vessel, which must have been quickly
dashed to pieces. The Paracelses reefs were completely
under water, masses of surging foam hiding
all trace of them, so that had any of the coolies
landed it would only have been to be swept quickly
away to the open sea by the force of the current.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps the saddest part of the tragedy was that
the fate of so many human creatures who had
disappeared for ever in the depths of that blind and
reckless destroyer, the Ocean, should have raised
so little regret, either amongst the white-skinned
traders in human flesh or the yellow-faced Celestials
of Macao and Hong-Kong. Maybe the latter
themselves realize that they really are too prolific,
and are not sorry when their numbers are lessened,
no matter by what means.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BARACOUNS</div>

<p>When I was at Macao, I saw some of the so-called
<i>baracouns</i>, where the emigrants used to be
shut up whilst awaiting their embarcation. These
<i>baracouns</i> are the disused vaults of old convents,
damp cellars of vast extent, which were closed
with strong bars when in use as pens for human
cattle. I am thankful to say these barracks are
empty now, and are no longer hot-beds of disease,
for the European powers have interfered to put a
stop to the infamous traffic. It is a great gratification
to me to know, on the authority of the
Quai d'Orsay officials, that an indignant article on
the subject, which I contributed to the <i>Revue des
Deux Mondes</i>, had something to do with this most
desirable step.</p>

<p>Emigration still goes on, on a very large scale,
but it is conducted in a less barbarous manner.
No Chinese can now be made to embark against
his will, and his signature to a contract no longer
compels him to leave his native land if he has any
means of support. As time goes on, it is to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
hoped that something like true liberty will really
be the heritage of the Chinese people, and already,
where European ideas are gaining ground, there are
glimmerings of the dawn of a better state of things.</p>

<p>In China, as elsewhere, the glory of the Portuguese
colonies is departed, and the settlement at Macao
is no exception to the rule. For many years the
name of that port was synonymous with decay and
degradation. The native population was more
debased; the foreign traders were more grasping,
more greedy of gain, and more reckless of the means
employed to secure it than anywhere else, and one
tri-colour flag, floating above a hospital for invalid
sailors, was the only note of true civilization to
redeem a deplorable state of things. The Sisters
of Charity, who had come all the way from France
to soothe the sufferings of European mariners in a
strange land, taught the people of Macao that
there was another love than that of the piastre,
another intoxication than that produced by the
fumes of opium: the love of helping others, the
intoxication of zeal for humanity. The much-abused
and hated Macao is now the seat of a
bishop and the head-quarters of French missionary
effort in China, whilst the export trade has passed
from the hands of the Portuguese into that of the
British, a truly beneficent change for all concerned.</p>

<p>My visit to the horrible <i>baracouns</i> made me
quite miserable, so vividly did they bring before me
all the horrors of the but recently-changed system
of compulsory emigration. I did my best to forget
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
them; and on the eve of my departure from Macao
I went to see the grotto associated with the name
of Camoens. It will be remembered that the poet
was banished to Macao in 1556 on account of his
quarrel with the authorities at Goa, whither he had
been sent after the fracas in the streets of Lisbon,
in which he wounded a royal equerry. He seems
on the whole to have enjoyed his exile, for he
obtained a post with a large salary, and in two
years made quite a fortune. This so-called grotto
is not really a cave now, whatever it may originally
have been, but is a picturesque little building
perched on a site commanding a beautiful view of the
bay and its shipping. Truly a fitting scene to inspire
the rhapsody in which Camoens celebrated the glory
of his fellow-countryman, Vasco da Gama, and bemoaned
the sad fate of the beautiful IÃ±ez de
Castro, who, the story goes, after being for some ten
years the mistress of the Infante of Portugal, Dom
Pedro, was secretly married to him in 1354, and
murdered by order of her father-in-law in 1355.
When the bereaved husband came to the throne
he put two of the murderers of his bride to death
by torture; and, according to Camoens, had the
dead body of IÃ±ez exhumed, dressed in royal robes,
and placed upon the throne she would have
occupied had she lived, to receive homage from
the court.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LUSIADS</div>

<p>In the <i>Lusiads</i>, which has been called the "Epos
of Commerce," and is to the Portuguese what
Chaucer's <i>Canterbury Tales</i> is to the English, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
vivid picture is given of the grandeur of the poet's
native country in the fifteenth century, when it was
the rival of Spain, and a leader in the colonization
of distant lands. Perhaps one of the finest passages
of this remarkable poem, or series of poems, is that
in which its author invokes the mighty spirit of the
storm, Adamastor, the fierce guardian of the Cape
of Good Hope, over whom Vasco da Gama and
Magellan, also of Portuguese birth, both triumphed.
Now that time has proved how fatal to the real
welfare of both Spain and Portugal was the wealth
of India and of Mexico, one cannot help feeling
that the poet may perhaps have had something
of a prophetic intuition of the future decadence
of the peninsular kingdoms, when he placed a
giant in the pathway of the Conquistadores, to
bar the way against them.</p>

<p>It has only been for the last forty years that
either China or Japan can be said to have been open
to Europeans. The history of the latter nation is
a proof of what an active, brave, and intelligent
people may achieve in the course of a few years;
whilst that of the former illustrates all that may
remain undone where the natives of a country are
convinced that they have for forty centuries had an
ideal government, the best possible religion, and
that the products of their industries are quite incapable
of improvement.</p>

<p>In passing judgment on the Chinese it must,
however, be borne in mind that their country is, by
its natural boundaries, so completely isolated from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the rest of the world as to justify to some extent
their intense reluctance to open relations with the
Red Devils of the West, as they call all Europeans,
whether fair or dark, though it was evidently the
bright auburn hair and rosy complexions of so
many of the English visitors to China which
originated the name. The giving of this title is the
only vengeance the poor yellow skins have been
able to take on those who invaded their capital,
pillaged their palaces and burnt their arsenals and
vessels, not to speak of the importation of the
pernicious drug, opium, which is responsible for the
death of thousands every year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BOUNDARIES OF CHINA</div>

<p>Independently of the Great Wall which once,
though not very successfully, defended China from
the incursions of the Mongols and Manchus, the
Celestial Empire is bounded on the north by
the great Gobi desert and the grass steppes of
Southern Mongolia; on the east by the sea of
China, the Eastern and the Yellow Seas; whilst on
the west rise many a lofty chain of mountains,
their summits almost always crowned with snow.
These latter have not yet been all fully explored,
though the name of many a hero of discovery is
connected with them, including that of Prince
Henry of Orleans, Margary and Marcel Monnier
of quite recent fame.</p>

<p>In the vast circle enclosed within these boundaries
of desert, mountain, and sea, nearly every
kind of vegetation can be successfully cultivated in
one district or another, whilst a considerable variety
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of types of the great human family is met with,
including members belonging to the same groups
as the people who have poured into Corea, Japan,
Formosa, the Philippine Islands, Indo-China, Siam,
Kulja, and even a country so far away as Persia.</p>

<p>As is well known, anthropologists are divided
into two absolutely distinct camps: the Polygenists,
who claim that differences of species
evidenced by differences in height, in features, and
in complexion, are the result of the springing of the
human race from different progenitors; and the
Monogenists, who believe in one primÃ¦val pair of
parents only, and look upon all differences between
human creatures as caused by accidental conditions
modifying the primitive type. The latter assert
that it was within the boundaries mentioned above,
on the central plateau of the present Celestial
Empire, that the first men appeared, and as they
multiplied, became diversified into yellow, black,
white, and red, remaining in their primitive home
until, like a cup filled too full, they overflowed in
every direction to people other lands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MONGOLIANS</div>

<p>It is not for me to decide the vexed question of
whether the polygenists or monogenists are in
the right; those curious on the subject may refer
to the learned and deeply interesting works of
Quatrefages, Haeckel, Darwin, Huxley, Wallace
and others, who have brought their critical acumen
to bear on the subject of the origin and antiquity
of man. I merely wish to emphasize here the fact
that all agree in believing China to have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
occupied at an extremely remote date, and in
admitting that, however the changes may have
come about, the human family is now undoubtedly
divided into five distinct groups: the brown, the
black, the red, the white, and the yellow. To the
last belong the Mongolians, with whom alone we
have now to do, and which numbers, whatever its
peculiarities, more representatives than any other
at the present day.</p>

<p>The skin of this prolific race is always yellow,
sometimes pale, and sometimes of a brownish tinge.
The stiff straight hair of the Mongol is as black
as ebony, and the skull is of the so-called bracycephalic
type, that is to say, short as compared to
its breadth, whilst that of the Chinese and Tartars
is mesaticephalic, or of medium length and breadth.</p>

<p>The face is round, the eyes are mere narrow
slits, often decidedly oblique, the nose is large, the
cheek-bones are very prominent, and the lips are
thick.</p>

<p>At first sight it would appear that the Mongolian
dialects all spring from one primitive speech, but
examination of evidence proves that this is not the
case, for they really belong to two very ancient
branches of human speech: the monosyllabic
language of the Indo-Chinese races, and the polysyllabic
of the other Mongolians. The Tibetans,
Burmans, Siamese, and Chinese dialects are all
monosyllabic, whilst those in use by the Coreans,
Japanese, Tartars, Kirghizes, Kalmucks, Buriats,
Samoyedes, and Finns are polysyllabic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>All the inhabitants of the continent of Asia, with
the exception of a few tribes of the extreme north,
certain groups of Malays and Dravidians in India,
with some of the dwellers in the Mediterranean
districts of the south-west, belong to the so-called
<i>Homo mongolicus</i>, or Mongolian branch of the
great human family, whilst in Europe it claims the
Finns and Lapps of the north, the Osmanlis of
Turkey, and the Magyars of Hungary. <i>Homo
articus</i>, or the Polar group, is considered by the
best authorities to have originally formed part of
the Mongolian branch, including the Esquimaux,
the Greenlanders, the Kamtchatkans, etc., all of
whom, however, as pointed out by Haeckel, the
great German naturalist, have in the course of
centuries become so modified by the conditions of
life in the Arctic regions, that they may now be
looked upon as forming a separate species.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the extreme north are short
and squat, their skulls are of the mesaticephalic,
or even in some cases of the dolichocephalic type,
that is to say, they are long in proportion to their
breadth; their eyes are narrow and oblique, as are
those of the Mongols; they have high cheek-bones
and large mouths. Their hair is coarse and black,
and their skin of a more or less clear brown colour,
sometimes approaching to white, and sometimes to
yellow, as amongst the Mongols, whilst now and
then it is reddish, as is that of the native
Americans. The dialects spoken by these remote
tribes differ as much from those of other Mongols
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
as they do from the American forms of speech, and
the probability is that these inhabitants of the
Arctic regions are really a degenerate branch of
the Mongol race, whose progenitors passed over
into the north of America from the north-east of
Asia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHINESE ISOLATION</div>

<p>In spite of the fact that emigrants did occasionally
drift across the formidable northern and western
boundaries of the vast Celestial Empire, the one
leading idea for many centuries, alike of rulers and
ruled, was to keep their land sacred from intruders,
and discourage all intercourse with other nations,
whom the Chinese were trained from infancy to
look upon as utter barbarians. There is no more
thrilling or more interesting story in literature
than that of how this cherished isolation was in
the end broken in upon and the delusion finally
dispelled, that Europe was but a small, sparsely
populated district, whose inhabitants were eager to
trade with the yellow men because of the poverty
of their own land.</p>

<p>The Russians and the Dutch, as well as the
Portuguese, were eager in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries to trade with China, and plant
permanent colonies within its boundaries, but self-interest
alone prompted their efforts, and they did
nothing to open the eyes of the natives to the true
character of western civilization. The French,
however, to their honour be it spoken, were the
pioneers of missionary effort, and as has been well
pointed out by Archibald Colquhoun in his <i>China in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Transformation</i>, page 43, "the earlier knowledge
of the West acquired by China, and that of China
acquired by the West, were mainly achieved by
French missionaries; no French Government ever
sent a mission to Pekin to seek merely advantages
of trade," and it was not until 1869 that a different
policy was inaugurated. Far different was it with
the English who obtained a footing in China, for
from the very first their one aim was to trade upon
the ignorance of the natives, and to make the largest
possible fortunes. British trade with China began
later than that of the other great Western powers,
but it rapidly grew to far greater importance than
that of Russia or Portugal, chiefly because it was
mainly carried on by that great and powerful commercial
body, the East India Company, on whom
rests the responsibility of the first introduction to the
Celestial Empire of opium, now consumed in such
immense quantities and cultivated in China itself,
but which was totally unknown there before the
eighteenth century. For over two centuries the
East India Company enjoyed a monopoly of trade,
and in their eagerness for gain its members swallowed
many an affront to their own and their
country's dignity, for their relations to the Chinese
Government resembled those of humble suppliants
to the "Son of Heaven."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EAST INDIA COMPANY</div>

<p>There is something deeply pathetic in the
gradual realization by that "Son of Heaven" that
the sons of earth from over the sea were really more
powerful than himself, and that he was the one to
be defeated in any real conflict with them. How
touching, for instance, was the edict issued in 1800,
the first year of the century, so fatal to China as a
nation, prohibiting the importation of opium, an
edict utterly powerless to check the evil, which was
spreading like a fatal blight throughout the length
and breadth of the doomed land. The traffic went
on unchecked, and between 1821 and 1831 the
amount landed at the various ports increased from
4628 chests to 23,670. In 1832 the monopoly of
the Company came to an end, and the heads of the
factories were succeeded by a representative of the
Sovereign of Great Britain, whom the Chinese
authorities hoped to coerce more easily than they
could the many-headed hydra the Company had
seemed to be. "On the one side," says Professor
Legge, "was a resistless force determined to prosecute
its enterprise for the enlargement of its
trade, and the conduct of it as with an equal nation;
on the other side, was the old Empire seeming to
be unconscious of its weakness, determined not to
acknowledge the claim of equality, and confident of
its power to suppress the import of opium." For
a brief space it seemed as if the latter would gain
the day, for England made the fatal mistake of
associating with her first representative, Lord
Napier, two men who had been in the hated East
India Company. The policy pursued was weak
and vacillating; Lord Napier was disowned by his
Government, and after suffering much indignity at
the hands of the Chinese, died at Macao of a broken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
heart. He was succeeded by Sir J. F. Davis, during
whose term of office the relations between the two
countries became more and more strained, until in
1839 the Chinese Government made its last final
effort to oust out alike the foreigners and the abuses
they had introduced, which were to it as an ever-present
canker eating into the life of the nation.
The able politician, Lin-Tseh-Hsu, was appointed
Governor-General of the Kwang provinces with
orders to bring the foreign devils to reason.</p>

<p>It so happened when the new ruler, who was "a
thoroughly orthodox Chinaman," arrived at Canton,
there were British ships in port with some twenty
thousand chests of opium on board. Lin at once
ordered these to be given up for destruction, and as
no notice was taken of his demand, he commanded
all the Chinese in the service of the foreigners to
leave them at once. They dared not disobey, and
when they were gone a cordon of troops was
posted round the British quarters, and a manifesto
was issued to the effect that unless the opium was
surrendered all the merchants would be slain.
Captain Eliot, who was Secretary to Sir J. F. Davis,
seeing no hope of rescue, gave up the opium, which
was flung with quantities of quick-lime, salt and
water into deep trenches at Chunhow, near the
mouth of the river, "where it quickly became
decomposed, and the mixture ran into the sea."</p>

<p>This and other high-handed measures of the
energetic Governor of Kwang led to the war which
resulted in the ceding of Hong-Kong to the English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
and the opening to British trade of Canton, Amoy,
Fuchan, Ningpo, and Shanghai. The spell was in
fact finally broken, Chinese isolation was at an
end for ever, and the first chapter was written of
the history of modern China. China is a land
doomed to partition amongst the hated "foreign
devils," who are eager to divide the spoil, and are
preparing to intersect the once sacred interior of
the flowery land with the relentless iron roads,
before the advance of which all privacy and
seclusion disappear.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PEKIN CONVENTION</div>

<p>The Treaty of Nanking, signed in 1842, was
succeeded after another war, which began in 1856
and ended in 1858, by the Treaty of Tien-tsin,
making yet further concessions to England; but
it was not until after the Anglo-French Expedition
had crossed the Pei-Ho river, and encamped beneath
the very walls of the capital itself, that the
Chinese realized how futile was further resistance.
The Convention of Pekin, signed in 1860, ratified
the Treaty of Tien-tsin, and formed the foundation
of the present relations between China and Great
Britain. The Emperor, Hsien-Fung, died the next
year, and his last hours must indeed have been
embittered by the knowledge that the flood-gates
were opened, and that he could only leave the
semblance of power to his successor, an infant of
five years old. Nothing could now check the
introduction of European civilization, which in the
eyes of the Chinese was synonymous with all that
was most detrimental to their true interests.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Fortunately, however, the advantages were not
really so entirely on the side of the foreigners as
is generally supposed; for the people will in the end,
it is hoped, lead better and nobler lives than before.
Missionaries of many nationalities are doing their
best against terrible odds to introduce the religion
of the Redeemer, and even in material matters
some good has resulted to the much-oppressed
natives. Numerous steamers have long plied unmolested
to and fro between the chief European
ports and Shanghai, and a system of custom-house
control has been established in that important
town of Central China, greatly to the advantage
of native trade. The taxes imposed on foreign
goods are now one of the most important sources
of the revenues of the Empire, and the driving
away of the "foreign devils" would mean an
incalculable loss to the Chinese themselves. The
total value of the exports from Shanghai alone is
more than Â£22,715,000, of which some Â£8,746,000
represents native produce from the immediate
neighbourhood of the port, whilst the imports,
including Chinese goods from other districts, reaches
a considerably higher figure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOPE FOR THE FUTURE</div>

<p>All this means prosperity
to the millions, who before the throwing
open of the inland provinces to foreign commerce,
lived from hand to mouth, and were ground
down by the ceaseless exactions of the native
officials. This truth is not unfortunately even
now really understood by the populace, for political
knowledge filters very slowly from the palace to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the hovels of China; but we may yet hope to see
the day when really cordial relations will be
established between the white and yellow races.
The defeat of China by Japan, with the huge indemnity
exacted by the latter, was of course a
terrible blow to commerce; but already there are
signs of recovery, for the wealth and numbers of
the people of the vast Empire are really alike
inexhaustible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whether</span>, as has been asserted by more than
one French writer, it was the French operations
in Tonkin which so roused the jealousy of the
British as to determine them at all risks to render
those operations futile in the opening of a direct
route from Yunnan to Burma, or whether they
were merely pursuing their usual astute policy of
making exploration precede the flag, there is no
doubt that the tragic fate of the young explorer,
Margary, whose adventurous journey deserves relation
here, was fruitful in most important political
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
results alike to England and to France. The
French, who looked upon Tonkin as their own
special key to China, had meant to make the
Song-coi, or Red River, which is its chief artery,
the outlet of the wealth of Yunnan; the English
succeeded in making the Yang-tse that outlet by
the concessions they wrung from the Chinese as
part of the indemnity for the murder of their
explorer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARGARY'S INSTRUCTIONS</div>

<p>It was in 1874 that Augustus Raimond Margary,
an <i>attachÃ©</i> of the British Embassy at Pekin,
received instructions from Sir Thomas Wade, then
Minister Plenipotentiary to China, to go to BhÃ¢mo,
and there meet Colonel Browne, who was about
to start on an expedition across Western China,
with a view to open the overland route between
Burma and the Celestial Empire. Margary, who
knew the natives well, and had on many occasions
given proof of his tact in dealing with them, was
to act as interpreter and guide to the English
party.</p>

<p>Already the Yang-tse, the great river at the mouth
of which Shanghai is situated, had been opened
to foreign trade as far as Hankow, that is to say,
for 600 miles, but the difficulties of communication
with the interior were still immense, so bad were
the roads, and so ignorant the people of the
districts those roads traversed. What was really
needed in the interests of British trade was a
continuous route partly by water and partly by
land from the port to Burma, and Margary was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
to test the practicability of such a route, although
the brutality of the natives to foreigners was well
known, and much of the district he had to traverse
had never before been visited by a European. Even
now, as those who have read Marcel Monnier's
account of his adventures in Yunnan in the pages
of the French journal <i>Le Temps</i> know full well,
there is anything but a cordial feeling for foreigners
in Yunnan, and a quarter of a century ago the
traveller who ventured far from Hankow must
have carried his life in his hand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARGARY IN DANGER</div>

<p>Nothing daunted, however, by all he knew of
the perils before him, the gallant young explorer
left Shanghai in a little American steamer on
August 24th, accompanied only by one English
servant and a Chinese secretary. Arrived at Hankow,
which, now that it is to be connected with
Pekin, Russian Siberia, and Tonkin by rail, has a
great future before it as a commercial centre, the
little party left the steamer and hired boats from
a native banker for the further voyage. They
started again on September 4th, and on the 6th
cast anchor off PaÃ¯-Chou, a picturesque town rising
from amongst magnificent trees. This town turned
out to be extremely well built, and prosperous, and
to be surrounded by well-cultivated plantations,
yielding quantities of valuable produce. Margary
and his secretary wandered about for some time,
noting everything, and at first the natives were
very civil; but when the visitors approached the
quay, to which the junks of the inhabitants were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
moored, the crowd became insulting, and followed
the travellers to their vessel, hooting them and
dancing round them with menacing gestures. They
escaped without injury, however, and pushed on
to Lu-Chi-Ku, where they saw a big war-junk,
with no less than twenty-one guns. On September
11th they reached Lo-Shan, where a halt
was made to await a reply to a telegram sent by
Margary to Sir Thomas Wade. No answer came,
however, and a whole week was wasted, during
which Margary nearly lost his life in a fracas with
the natives. The heat was intense, and but for the
shade of the fine mulberry trees on the banks of
the river, would have been almost insupportable.
In spite of it the Englishman spent most of his
time shooting the plentiful game, consisting chiefly
of partridges and pheasants. One day he had left
his gun behind him, to go and call on a mandarin,
who held an official post at Lo-Shan. As he was
being carried in a sedan-chair by native porters, he
suddenly met a gang of conscripts bound for
Formosa, who surrounded him, shouting, "Ha!
Ha! here is a foreign devil&mdash;let us do for the
foreign devil!" How the "foreign devil" wished
he had had his stout club in his hand, he would
quickly have dispersed the cowardly mob; but
seeing he was absolutely defenceless, the soldiers
seized the ends of the bamboo rods supporting the
chair, and began shaking its occupant about in a
most unpleasant manner. With a quiet smile on
his lips, but hatred in his heart, Margary was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
meditating a blow with his clenched fist in the face
of the ringleader, when his servant relieved the
tension of the situation by striking one of the
assailants in the chest with all his force. The
result was magical and immediate, the brave
soldiers all ran away, and the "foreign devil"
arrived safely at the house of the mandarin.
Fortunately that official
proved friendly, and gave
his visitor the escort of
two lictors for his return
on board. Back again
in his own boat, the
explorer harangued the crowd, which still lingered
on the bank, in these words: "Why did you treat
me so roughly? Is this your politeness to strangers?
I had heard that the Chinese were distinguished
amongst other nations for their courtesy. Is this
how you show it? Shall I go and tell my fellow-countrymen
how you treat me?" This speech, in
their own language, greatly astonished the audience,
who received it in silence, and quietly withdrew,
apparently quite ashamed of themselves, the older
amongst them trying to lay the blame on the
younger.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TUNG-TING LAKE</div>

<p>On September 20th Margary gave up all hope
of hearing from Sir Thomas Wade, and resumed
his voyage, feeling rather out of heart, no doubt,
at the silence of his chief Helped by a strong
wind from the north-east, he succeeded the same
day in leaving the muddy Yang-tse, and entering
the beautiful Tung-Ting lake, of a lovely blue
colour, from which the Great River draws its chief
volume. At the entrance to this lovely sheet of
water is the island of ChÃ¼n-Shan, celebrated
throughout the Celestial Empire for its tea, considered
the best in China, a portion of which is set
apart for the use of the Son of Heaven, or the
Emperor, and for the chief dignitaries of the province
in which it is grown. The lake, lovely as it
is in appearance, is of little depth, and except for
the clouds of venomous insects which hover over it,
inflicting torture on those who venture to navigate
it, there is but little life about it. A few towns
of no particular importance rise from its banks,
but Margary did not land at any of them. The
natives of the shores of the lake say that the flies
which haunt the surface of the water are the
winged guardians, appointed by the Spirit of the
Lake, to keep away intruders.</p>

<p>On the 22nd the explorer entered the river
Yuen, a stream of transparent waters, and halted
for a brief time opposite the town of Nih-sin-Tang,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
where, to his relief, the winged and barbed sentinels
of the lake melted away as rapidly as they had
appeared.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">FIG. 34.&mdash;A CHINESE FERRYMAN.</div>
</div>

<p>The banks of the Yuen are extremely picturesque:
instead of the sewers and rugged paths which
generally disfigure the banks of the water-courses
of China, the riverine districts consist of well-cultivated
land,
cotton plantations
alternating
with beautiful
meadows bordered
by venerable
willows. The
farms, too, are
clean and well
kept; men, women
and children
seem to lead
happy, prosperous
lives, and
Margary was
everywhere kindly received. At sunrise, on the
28th, the expedition arrived opposite Tao-Yuen-Hsien,
a large, prosperous, but unwalled town.
This was the first important place without fortifications
which Margary had visited. The
inhabitants seemed very independent, and their
chief industry was the making of pottery; every
house, of whatever size, was decorated inside and
out with tasty vases, serving as pots for the dwarf
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
orange trees and other stunted plants in which the
Chinese take so great a delight.</p>

<p>Beyond Tao-Yuen-Hsien the river narrows, and
flows between rocky gorges, beyond which low
conical hills, covered with sombre pines, rise one
above the other, none of them more than about
200 feet high, the effect of which is, nevertheless,
extremely fine. From the description given of the
scenery by Margary, it must greatly resemble that
of Civet in the Ardennes, immortalized by George
Sand in her poetical romance, <i>MalgrÃ© tout</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN OLD FRIEND</div>

<p>The province of Hunan, so rich in geological
interest, and in which such terrible convulsions
must have taken place in the remote past, was now
entered, and the important town of Yuping-Hsien
was soon reached, where the drooping spirits of
Margary were cheered by finding the chief magistrate
to be an old friend of his, who had formerly
been interpreter in the English legation at Pekin.
The native official received his former colleague
with a salute from three guns, and, better still,
wished him to spend a few days with him at his
own residence. Margary gladly accepted the hospitality
offered, donned his dress-uniform, and was
carried in state to the Yamin or house of the
magistrate, where a great crowd was assembled to
witness the arrival of the foreigner.</p>

<p>Refreshed by his rest, the English explorer soon
started again, and on October 27th reached the
important town of Chen-Yuan-Fu, at the entrance
to which is a very fine bridge of six arches, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
would be considered a work of art even in Europe.
Round about the city rise rocky heights, which give
it a very picturesque appearance. Margary landed
near the bridge, for he would now have to travel
by land, and accompanied by his own servant and
four men who had been told off to protect him, he
made his way to a house where he hoped to be
able to spend the night. It was not exactly a
hotel, but a stopping-place where travellers could
hire sedan-chairs, coolies, and horses; in fact, all
that was needed for the further prosecution of his
journey. As there are generally several such
establishments in every important place, the
Chinese proprietors always send agents down to
the landing-stages to secure the custom of travellers
just as do their brethren in Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A RAGING MULTITUDE</div>

<p>Now the messenger who had got Margary to promise to
patronize his master's house, had disappeared as
soon as he had transacted the business in hand,
leaving the English traveller and his men in the
lurch. It was only with the greatest difficulty that
the little party made their way to the caravanserai
chosen, through the crowds assembled to stare at
them. Arrived there, they found a clean, comfortable-looking
shelter, but no one to receive them.
The next thing to do was to get the baggage of
the expedition under shelter, but to this the crowd
outside objected so very vigorously that Margary
was obliged to give up the attempt. He determined,
however, to seek the aid and protection of
the Hsien, or first magistrate of the town, and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
force his way to him in spite of all opposition. He
had the door of the caravanserai opened, and faced
the raging multitude outside with head erect and
an air of such determined resolution, that the easily
daunted Chinese recoiled before him, and withdrawing
as he advanced, allowed him to reach the
Yamin unhurt. There he found the chief magistrate,
who must have heard all the noise, for the
caravanserai was only some two hundred paces off,
quietly awaiting events without moving a finger to
control them.</p>

<img src="images/fig35.png" width="298" height="355" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">FIG. 35.&mdash;A MANDARIN'S HOUSE.</div>
</div>

<p>Margary could not persuade the official to let
him remain for a night's rest in the town, but he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
did succeed in securing four sturdy coolies as
porters, by whom he was carried from. Chen-Yuan,
where he had been so grossly insulted, to Kwei-Yang,
capital of the province of Kwei-Chou,
receiving a kind welcome everywhere <i>en route</i>.</p>

<p>Three days before his arrival at Yunnan, capital
of the province of the same name, as the English
explorer was taking his lunch <i>al fresco</i>, he was, to
his great surprise and delight, accosted by a Frenchman,
an unfortunate missionary, who was bound
for the same place, and was nearly wild with joy
at finding another European in this remote
district. An eager conversation began in Chinese,
but as Margary could speak French, the native
language was soon exchanged for it. Margary
tells how the two sat down to the same "table," and
were to share their meal, but the missionary was
so badly off for provisions that, in the end, the
Englishman gave him half his beefsteak, with all
the bread he had. Then he had an omelette made
for his guest, and gave him a glass of spirits. From
the eagerness with which the food was consumed it
was evident that the poor fellow had been almost
starving. The meal over, Margary told his new
friend of the way in which he had been insulted
at Chen-Yuan, and the Frenchman replied that
most likely the magistrate had taken the explorer
for a Jesuit father, or a Lazarist, that is to say,
a follower of Saint Vincent de Paul. However it
may be in the future, the people of Central China
had in Margary's time no toleration for Roman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Catholic missionaries, and there was little chance
of their doing anything to promote civilization
amongst the natives. Had the magistrate looked
at the Englishman's passport when the latter first
landed he would have been very differently treated.
It will be traders, not preachers of the gospel, who
will be the first to introduce European ideas. Even
manufacturers and engineers who elsewhere often
achieve so much success have little chance in
China, for the people are as content with their own
systems of mechanical production and their clumsy
primitive modes of working their salt and mineral
mines as they are with their religion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A FRENCH BISHOP</div>

<p>At Hwei-Chow, a picturesque walled city of
great importance, Margary met an old French
bishop and two of his priests who had adopted the
costume of the Chinese, and spoke their language
even better than their own. The bishop, in fact,
had been so long expatriated that he had forgotten
his own tongue, and spoke that of his adopted
country with his visitor. In fact, instead of converting
the natives he had become almost a native
himself, a sad fate for a once ardent missionary.
He lived in a Yamin and used a green arm-chair,
a privilege accorded generally to officials of Chinese
birth only. He was even called Ta-jin, or a great
man, a title reserved, as a rule, for mandarins of the
first class. Though this assumption of native titles
cannot but have been displeasing to the literati and
officials, the fact that the bishop was left unmolested
is a singular instance of tolerance; for what would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
be thought in Europe of a Chinaman who should
venture to adopt the uniform of a general or the
robes of a cardinal? Would not steps be taken at
once to despoil him of his borrowed plumes?</p>

<p>It was now three months since Margary had left
Shanghai, and forty-nine days more would be
required before he could reach BhÃ¢mo on the
Irrawadi, where he hoped to meet Colonel Browne,
with whom he was to make the return journey, if
the Chinese authorities would give the necessary
permission. There seemed no reason to suppose
that it would be refused, for nothing could have
been more cordial than the reception of the young
Englishman in the capital of Yunnan.</p>

<p>The road from Yunnan-Fow to Tali-Fow was
really little more than a goat-track, and Margary
gives an amusing account of his own sufferings
and those of two mandarins who made the journey
with him, as he was jolted along amongst the
crowds of carts, mules, and donkeys which blocked
the way, all alike laden with bags of salt. The
Englishmen and the literati had many a laugh together
over their misfortunes, and the way he made
friends with pretty well every one he met speaks
volumes for the tact of the explorer, who deserved
a better fate than that which eventually befell him.</p>

<p>It was now December, and the cold was intense,
but it was impossible to procure winter clothing,
and the travellers had to make the best of what
they happened to have with them. As Chen-nan
was four days' journey from Tali-Fow, the mandarins
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
did all they could to dissuade Margary from
going further, assuring him that the people of the
last-named town were very hostile to foreigners;
but the Englishman, anxious to ascertain the truth
about native feeling for Europeans from actual
observation, was not to be deterred. On the 16th
December he boldly entered the city of inhospitable
reputation, and wrote in his journal: <i>Veni, vidi,
vici!</i> He was unmolested, and weary though he
was, he remained but one night to rest, pushing
on the next day for the Burmese frontier. He
reached Manwyne, the scene soon afterwards of
his assassination, on January 11th, and there found
an escort of forty soldiers from Burma sent to him
by Colonel Browne to protect him from attack by
the tribes of the frontier districts through which he
had now to pass. It is very probable that the
sudden appearance of all these armed men was
really the cause of Margary's death. Alone, the
gallant young explorer would have conciliated the
friendship of the natives as he had so often done
before, but surrounded by his guard he naturally
became an object of suspicion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARGARY REACHES BHÃ‚MO</div>

<p>Margary did, however, succeed in reaching BhÃ¢mo,
and suspecting no danger, he and Colonel Browne
started on the return journey early in February,
reaching on the 18th of that month the last post in
Burma, just beyond the Chinese frontier. There
the travellers learnt that the pass into Yunnan was
blocked by an armed band of Kakhyens, whose
opposition to the re-entry into China of the white
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
men, if not exactly instigated was certainly connived
at by the authorities of the frontier town of
Seray, and also by those of Manwyne. Colonel
Browne and Margary consulted together as to what
was best to be done, and the latter, who had just
crossed Yunnan so successfully, assured his companion
that they need fear nothing; he had only
recently been kindly received at both the towns
mentioned above, and he proposed with his usual
enterprising spirit that he should go on alone to
test the accuracy of the various rumours afloat,
promising to send back a messenger with news as
soon as possible.</p>

<p>It was indeed unfortunate that the Colonel
should have agreed to this rash suggestion, and
allowed his unfortunate young colleague to go to
his death. Little dreaming of the approaching
tragedy, however, the two sat over their last meal
together till far into the night, discussing the
probable results of their expedition, regardless of
the noise made by the beating of gongs and playing
of cymbals to be heard from the pass, and of the
fact that they could actually see the Kakhyens
spying upon them from the lofty trees overlooking
their camp.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MURDER OF MARGARY</div>

<p>At sunrise on the 19th Margary crossed the
frontier, accompanied by his faithful secretary, the
servants who had been with him since he left
Shanghai, and a few Burmese muleteers. The next
day Colonel Browne received a letter from him
announcing his safe arrival at Seray, adding that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
he had been well received there, and was now on
his way to Manwyne. The rest of the expedition
followed in his footsteps, arriving at Seray on the
21st. No further news was received from Margary,
but Colonel Browne was alarmed by rumours that
he and his people were to be attacked, and by the
fact that the chief mandarin of the place was arming
his retainers. On the morning of the 22nd the
storm burst, the Colonel's camp was surrounded by
armed men, and at the same time letters were
received from some Burmans residing at Manwyne
telling of the cowardly assassination of Margary
in that town.</p>

<p>But for the courage and steadfastness of his
Burmese escort, especially of fifteen sepoys who
formed a kind of body-guard. Colonel Browne
would have shared the fate of his young fellow-countryman,
but after a fierce struggle he succeeded
in re-crossing the frontier with no worse casualties
than three men wounded.</p>

<p>From BhÃ¢mo every possible effort was made to
ascertain the truth about the murder of Margary,
but full details were never obtained. The most
apparently trustworthy account was that given by
a Burmese, who said he had seen the victim at
Manwyne several times on the 21st, once alone and
later walking with several Chinese. According to
this witness, the young Englishman had been
invited to ride out to see a spring of warm water,
and that just as he issued from the town he was
suddenly dispatched with their spears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus apparently ended the attempt to open the
land route between Burma and China, but as a
matter of fact the death of Margary eventually
did more for the interests of his country than the
peaceful conclusion of Colonel Browne's expedition
could ever have accomplished. The English know
how to turn to account every incident, however
tragic, however seemingly adverse to their own
interests, and the indemnity wrung from the
reluctant Chinese for the murder of the young
Englishman included the opening of another 400
miles of the great river above Hankow, an immense
step in advance towards the realization of the
long-cherished British ambition; the connection of
the Upper Yang-tze with Burma, so justly called
England's land-gate to China. It is, in fact, in the
provinces of Szechuan and Yunnan that the
question of which European power is to have the
supremacy in Central China will be finally fought
out, and therefore every concession won in connection
with them is alike of immense commercial and
political significance.</p>

detail all the negotiations which took place after
the death of Margary, between Sir Thomas Wade
and the Government of Pekin, on the subject of the
reparation to be made for the murder. It will be
enough to say that after twenty months of shilly-shallying
on the part of the Chinese and dogged
perseverance on that of the British Envoy, the latter
demanded his passports, shut up his legation with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
considerable <i>Ã©clat</i>, and retired on board a man-of-war
in the port of Tien-tsin, whence he issued
a dignified threat of the imminent declaration of
war between England and China if his demands
were not complied with. This brought the Chinese
Government to reason, for the Emperor and his
advisers felt it would be better to yield everything
than to see a victorious English army march a
second time into Pekin. Sir Thomas Wade was
therefore invited to meet the now celebrated Li-Hung-Chang,
who became later so well-known in
London and in Paris, at Che-Foo, a treaty port
on the northern side of the province of Shantung,
and there was signed the famous convention, of
which on account of its great importance a <i>rÃ©sumÃ©</i>
of the principal clauses is given here:</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CHE-FOO CONVENTION</div>

<p>A large money indemnity, Â£60,000, was to be
paid to the English Ambassador, to be distributed
amongst the families of Europeans who should be
in want or have lost their bread-winners in Yunnan.
An Imperial edict would be sent to the Viceroy of
Yunnan, who should discuss with some English
official, a commercial treaty between Burma and
the Chinese frontier province, where Margary met
his fate. England was to have the right of appointing
a representative at Tali-Fow, and he was to be
seconded in his researches by the Chinese authorities;
the country was to be opened to commerce; to
avoid misunderstandings it would be for the Tsung-li-Yamen,
or ministers of foreign affairs, to invite the
various European legations to draw up and submit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
to them a code of etiquette by which alike the
Chinese and foreign signatories to the agreement
should be bound. China should send consuls and
ambassadors to foreign countries; when a Chinese
accused of a crime against a European is tried by
the Chinese authorities, the European authorities
shall have a right to be present in the court, but they
must not interfere; it is to be the same if the guilty
person is a European who is tried by Englishmen.
If, however, the representative of one of the two
powers is not satisfied with the verdict given, he
will have the right to protest. The penalty inflicted
on the condemned will be that prescribed by
the law of the country to which the judge belongs;
the <i>likin</i>, or inland tax, imposed on foreign goods
in transit, is no longer to be exacted in the
concessions belonging to Europeans; China will
permit Ichang in the province of Hupe, Wu-hu in
Anhui, Wenchow in Che-kiang, and Pak-hoÃ¯ in
Canton to be opened to European trade; consuls
shall also be allowed to reside in each of these towns.
Acting in a spirit of conciliation China will allow
foreign steamers to take passengers and merchandise
to the following ports on the Yang-tse: Ta-Tung,
Anking, Hukow, Wusuch, Ling-hi-Kow, and
Sha-Shi. Furthermore, if foreign expeditions wish
to go by way of the Kan-su and Kokconor route
or by the way of Szechuan to Thibet and thence
to India, the Tsung-li-Yamen will give the necessary
passports to those expeditions, and instructions
will also be sent to the Chinese officials of Thibet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
in order that the explorers may travel in all
security.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">FIG. 36.&mdash;PORTRAIT OF HIS EXCELLENCY<br />LI-HUNG-CHANG.</div>
</div>

<p>This convention, which if fully acted on would
have completely revolutionized the position of
Europeans in China, was signed on the 13th
September, 1876, but though more than twenty-two
years have passed since then, much of it still
remains a dead letter. Now, however, there are
many signs of the inauguration of a very different
state of things; Chinese procrastinations and
delays can no longer avert the final opening up
of the whole country to European commerce and
colonization, the only question being which of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
European powers will secure the largest share of
the undeveloped wealth of the inland provinces.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ICHANG</div>

<p>It will be interesting before going further to
inquire what is the present position of one or two
of the ports mentioned in the <i>rÃ©sumÃ©</i> just given
of the Treaty of 1876. We will begin with Ichang,
recent events having brought it into considerable
prominence. Beautifully situated on the banks of
the Yang-tse, one thousand miles from its mouth,
just at the entrance to the grand ravines of its
middle course, great things were hoped of Ichang
by the few Europeans who, emboldened by the
delusive promises of the Chinese Government, took
up their residence there in the early eighties. In
1883, we are told by Archibald Little, the intrepid
English explorer, who last year took a specially-constructed
steamer up to Chung-Ting, 500 miles
beyond Ichang, "the foreign community in the
latter town comprised a commissioner of customs
with three assistants; one Scotch Presbyterian
minister and his wife, and two Roman Catholic
missionaries; whilst in 1898 the foreigners had
increased to twelve Europeans employed in the
Imperial customs, and thirty missionaries. The
trade," he adds, "is a busy retail one, but there are
no large banks or wealthy wholesale merchants
such as there are at Sha-Shi, eighty miles lower
down the river, which has been called the 'Manchester
of Western China.' The opening to navigation
of the Upper Yang-tse will doubtless ere
long change all that, and the English owe a debt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
of gratitude to the pioneers who have broken
through the long-sustained opposition of the junk-ring
to the use of steamers. Ichang will, it is
hoped, ere long become what its position marks it
out to be&mdash;a centre of foreign trade for the long-closed
border districts of Western China."</p>

<div class="sidenote">PAK-HOÃ</div>

<p>Pak-hoÃ¯, another of the Treaty ports of the 1876
Convention, presents a very marked contrast to
Ichang. It is a town of some 10,000 inhabitants
in the province of Canton, on the northern shore
of Tonking, and is likely, now that the concession
for the railway between it and Nanking has been
secured by the French Government, to be of great
importance as a port of export. Unfortunately,
however, it has not a good harbour, and as at
Hankow, large vessels are compelled to anchor in
the offing on account of the lowness of the water
further inshore. The chief imports to Pak-hoÃ¯ are
cotton and woollen goods, opium and rice, whilst
the exports are sugar, ground-nut oil, aniseed,
betel-vine leaves, and other spices. Lovers of
sport will find plenty of woodcock, partridges,
wild-ducks, and other water-fowl in the neighbourhood
of Pak-hoÃ¯. Opposite to the town, in the
south of the bay, is a very celebrated pagoda, one
of the most remarkable in China. From its centre
grows a magnificent plane-tree, in which nest
thousands of sparrows. The branches have forced
their way through the windows of the building,
and the masses of dark green foliage, contrasting
as they do with the stonework, produce a most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
charming and picturesque effect. The bay on
which Pak-hoÃ¯ is situated is dotted with islands,
and in them many French missionaries have taken
up their abode, adopting the costumes and many
of the customs of the natives, including the wearing
of the pig-tail. One of these devoted soldiers of
the Cross had been an exile from his native land
for nineteen years.</p>

<p>Pak-hoÃ¯ was opened to trade with considerable
ceremony in the presence of the English Consul
and several mandarins of high standing. The
foreign flags were saluted by the Chinese with a
volley from two guns, and the director of the new
Custom House let off a number of crackers amongst
the assembled crowds with a view to warning off
evil spirits, who, in the opinion of the Celestials,
are afraid of them. In spite of the expenditure
of gunpowder, the receipts of the Pak-hoÃ¯ Customs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
officers have so far remained insignificant, though
there is every probability of a considerable increase
in the near future.</p>

<p>It so happened that when I visited the town the
<i>fÃ©te</i> of the New Year was being celebrated, which
prevented my giving as much attention as I might
otherwise have done to the statistics of trade. The
year begins in China fifteen days after the rising
of the February moon, and at this <i>fÃ©te</i> the Celestials,
who are generally so devoted to business, throw
aside all occupation and give themselves completely
up to amusement. There is no Sabbath
or weekly day of rest in this land of the yellow
races, which perhaps accounts for the intense zest
with which they enjoy the annual fortnight of
repose.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NEW YEAR'S PRESENTS</div>

<p>On the eve of the holiday the Chinese merchant
puts his business affairs into scrupulous order,
balancing his accounts as he sits at his desk, bending
over his numerous little ledgers, or his calculator
made of tiny balls of ivory, his big spectacles upon
his nose, and a pencil or a reed pen in his hand.
His work done, he locks up his books and hastens
off to don his very best clothes; then holding fast
the indispensable fan, he runs off to the theatres
and the flower-boats, treats his friends and becomes
intoxicated as they do with opium, or with champagne,
to the deafening accompaniment of the
beating of gongs, or the explosion of thousands of
crackers. Or if he is fonder of play than of drinking,
he goes to some sordid gambling-den and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
there in a few hours dissipates the results of a whole
year of toil. As in France at the beginning of
a new year many presents are exchanged by the
Celestials, and a well-brought-up Chinaman sends
to each of his friends a little square piece of red
paper on which, side by side with the name of the
donor, is inscribed some wise precept of Confucius.
To the women with whom he is on visiting terms
he will present small lacquer articles, microscopic
shrubs, or quaint representations of fish with red
scales and golden fins. If he is anxious to secure
the patronage of some merchant or trader, he will
send him beautiful fruit, such as Mandarin oranges,
dainty hams, or sugar-candy, according to what he
knows to be the recipient's special weakness.</p>

<p>At the <i>fÃ©te</i> of the New Year the wives of the
mandarins and other officials exchange visits in
their ornate palanquins, dressed up in their finest
silk dresses, generally
either yellow or blue,
and with their faces
laden with rouge.
Endless is the talk
these decked-out
dames have together,
as they sip their tea
from tiny little cups,
and nibble sweets, or
munch up immense
quantities of dried
and strongly-salted
slices of water-melon.
At these feminine reunions,
too, there is a
good deal of singing,
and the voices are
pitched so high that
a stranger passing by
a house where a concert
was going on
would think a lot of
amorous cats were
yelling on the roof.</p>

<p>None of the lower classes will do any work
on a general holiday, and the coolies, palanquin-bearers,
and boatmen, who have not much money
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
to risk, content themselves with playing at the
popular and almost cosmopolitan game of morra
at the street-corners, shouting and laughing over it
with wonderful animation, forty Celestials making
more noise than would five hundred Europeans.
Sometimes the game ends in a quarrel, but even
when he is insulted a Chinaman never fights; his
mode of working off his spleen is quite unlike that
of the corresponding class in the West.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WENCHOW</div>

<p>Wenchow is an important town on the coast of
the fertile and beautifully-wooded province of
Che-kiang, and is about equidistant from Fuchau
and Tsing-Ho. It is the port of embarkation for
great quantities of tea, and considerable trade is
done in it in bamboo, wood, and timber. It is a
bright, clean-looking town, as well kept as any in
the Flowery Land, as Chinese authors love to call
their country, and the streets are said by travellers
to be wider than those of any other city of the
Celestial Empire. There are, moreover, such an
immense number of temples, that inns being scarce,
Europeans often lodge in the sacred buildings, the
natives offering no objection; but it must be
added that in many parts of China, pagodas are
turned to account as caravanserais in which any
one is allowed to sleep and to cook food. In
spite of all the stories told of the bigotry of the
Chinese, and of the awful penalties exacted for
sacrilege, there is really no doubt that taken as
a whole the inhabitants of the Celestial Empire
are really less intolerant than those of Europe, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
fact which should not be forgotten in passing
judgment upon them. The port of Wenchow has
increased rapidly in prosperity since the Convention
of 1876 threw it open to European trade,
and many foreign vessels are always in the harbour,
discharging their cargoes of various stuffs, or taking
Chinese merchandise on board.</p>

<p>Wu-hu, fifty miles from Nanking, is on the Yang-tse,
and so far has not profited very much by its
new privileges, though it now seems likely to become
a centre of the rice-exporting trade of the
surrounding districts. The story goes that the
first Englishman to settle in Wu-hu wrote to a
fellow-countryman at Shanghai soon after his
arrival, to say he had drunk so much champagne
with the Chinese governor that he was quite unable
to describe his new quarters. He had arrived
in a snow-storm, a happy augury according to the
natives, but far from a pleasant one to a European.
Wu-hu is the residence of a civil magistrate, and
of a <i>tao-tai</i>, whose duties are very much those of
a Prefect in French towns. There are also a
colonel, who has two regiments of soldiers under
him, and two naval officers in the Imperial service.
One of the latter is in command of the fleet
stationed at the mouth of the Yang-tse, the other
looks after the gun-boats which act as the river
police. The town is well built, the chief street is
a league long, well paved and bordered by beautiful
houses, some two storeys high, and all decorated
with red or black lacquer signs on which stand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
out the names in golden letters of the merchants
owning them. When this fine street is lit up by
the oblique rays of the setting sun the effect is
as dazzling as at Canton itself. The climate is
healthy, the people are friendly to foreigners, so
that many causes combine to make Wu-hu a pleasant
place of residence for Europeans. It must,
however, be added that the mandarins and government
officials are alike hostile to missionaries.</p>

<p>On every side of the town, except of course on
that of the river, stretch vast plantations of rice
and corn-fields. A raised causeway crosses these
beautiful and well-kept districts, along which I
went with a fellow-countryman, a French naval
officer, to be present at a noisy demonstration by
the natives in honour of an eclipse of the moon.
On this occasion, however, the satellite of our
earth so much beloved by poets played the
astronomers of Pekin a very scurvy trick.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A FICKLE SATELLITE</div>

<p>The learned members of the Kin-Tien-Kien, or
Imperial astronomers, had with all due solemnity
announced to the Emperor of China, the Son of
Heaven, as well as to all the provincial governors,
that on the 7th February at eight o'clock in the
evening precisely, the dragon who wanders to and
fro in the regions of the air, <i>quÃ¦rens quem devoret</i>,
will endeavour to swallow the moon. The eclipse
was to be almost total, so the astronomers had
warned the people that the attack of the monster
would be terrible, and that the pale satellite of the
earth would very likely succumb if the shouts and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the noise of the gongs did not put the dragon to
flight.</p>

<p>Long before the appointed time on the day
when the tragedy was expected to come off,
millions of Chinese issued from all the towns of
the vast Empire to flock out into the open country,
there, nose in air, to watch the wonderful phenomenon
about, as they supposed, to take place.
Those amongst them who had been unable to
get gongs, had provided themselves with saucepans,
rattles, pieces of the hollow stems of the bamboo,
and immense quantities of little red crackers. But,
oh, what a disappointment! Oh, what a fraud!
At eight o'clock the gazing multitudes saw the
moon rise above the horizon in all the untarnished
glory of her full disc, without the slightest sign of
any alteration in her usual appearance. At nine
o'clock she was shining placidly down upon the
watchers, her radiance totally unimpaired. Was
the whole thing a mystification, a fabrication of
the astronomers? But just as all hope was being
regretfully abandoned, a tremendous noise began
on every side, for the watchers saw a change
coming over the face of the planet, which was
assuming a reddish hue like that of blood, whilst
a hideous black spot was slowly advancing across
it. The dragon was beginning his attack.</p>

<p>It is absolutely impossible to describe the rage
with which the Chinese then began to beat their
gongs and saucepans, whirl their rattles, and let
off their crackers. The dragon was evidently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
frightened away by the row, for after an hour of
looking up at the full moon, and seeing nothing
more of the black spot, the crowds, jubilant over
their action, began to disperse, whilst the planet
triumphantly continued her course through space.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HI AND HO BEHEADED</div>

<p>I learnt later that the Emperor sent a message
to his astronomers telling them that next time
they made such a mistake in their calculations he
would relieve them of their appointments and send
them into exile. In the reign of Tchung Kang,
2155 years before the Christian era, his astronomers
named Hi and Ho were beheaded for not having
foreseen an eclipse of the sun. Father Gaubil, in
his interesting <i>History of Chinese Astronomy</i>, explains
the reasons of this very severe punishment
as follows:</p>

<p>"In China an eclipse of the sun or of the moon
is considered of evil augury for the Emperor,
intended to warn him to examine himself and
correct his faults.... Hence an eclipse is always
looked upon as an affair of state in the Celestial
Empire, and the greatest care is taken to calculate
the time when one will take place, as well as to
observe it whilst it is going on with the ceremonies
prescribed on such occasions. Now this time Hi
and Ho had failed altogether to announce the
approaching event, and when the orb of day was
suddenly obscured, the mandarins, not expecting an
eclipse, hastened to the palace in alarmed dismay.
The confusion which ensued of course terrified the
people, who had also been left in ignorance of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
approaching phenomenon. The whole course of
the proper proceedings on these occasions is presented
in the ancient book of rites. Directly the
light of the sun begins to grow dim, the chief musician
strikes a drum, and the mandarins are all expected
to hurry at once to the palace armed with bows
and arrows, as if to aid the Emperor, who is supposed
to be the image of the sun. All the officials,
moreover, have to offer their sovereign pieces of
silk. Meanwhile the Emperor and the chief dignitaries
of the court don their simplest garments and
fast. As the astronomers did not give the usual
notice, all these ceremonies, generally so religiously
observed, were neglected, and, although Hi and
Ho were princes as well as men of science, they
had to pay the penalty of their neglect. They
were not at court at the time, but at their country
seats, where, said Rumour, they were conspiring
against their sovereign. They were arrested, and
without any trial the Emperor ordered their heads
to be cut off. Thus dramatically ended an episode
thoroughly characteristic of the Celestial Empire,
where the Son of Heaven has ever been ready to
order those who annoy him on earth to be decapitated,
inquiring into their conduct only when
the proving of their innocence can do them no
good."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I landed on the vast estuary from which
rises up the important town of Shanghai, I really
could hardly believe I was but forty days' voyage
from Marseilles. Our world is no such big one
after all, it is true, but how many centuries it has
taken to learn much about it! "Did you ever hear
of Napoleon?" I one day asked a Celestial, who
had a shining glass button on his cap. "Don't
know whom you mean," he answered, with a
bewildered look, and there is not much doubt that
if he had asked me about some great Chinese
Emperor, I should have been just as puzzled as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
he was. All this will, however, ere long be
changed, what with steam and electricity, especially
with electricity, which puts a girdle round the
earth in a very few minutes, fleet messenger that
it is of peace, of war, of ruin, and of fortune.
When the various races of the earth know each
other better, we shall perhaps become more tolerant
of each other, more interdependent, so to speak,
and that cannot fail to be an advantage for all
concerned. When a blow struck in the East is
enough to shake the West to its foundations, we
shall think twice before we give that blow. The
more frequent the intercourse between the various
races of the earth, the nearer we shall be, in spite
of many a bitter disappointment, to that era of
universal peace to which every nation has aspired
in vain for so many centuries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXPORTS AND IMPORTS</div>

<p>Such were some of my reflections when I found
myself for the first time in the midst of the busy
scenes on the quays of Shanghai, surrounded by
countless bales of silk and cases of tea waiting for
embarkation for the West from whence I came.
Shanghai, as is well known, is the port of entry
of that great water highway of Western China,
the Yang-tse, but it is more than that, it is the
commercial capital of the Celestial Empire, for, as
stated by Colquhoun in his <i>China in Transformation</i>,
fifty-five per cent, of the total value of the
foreign imports at all the treaty ports, and forty-eight
per cent, of the exports to foreign countries
pass through the port of Shanghai. "Four years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
ago the value of the trade, native and foreign, of
this great emporium of the East was estimated at
no less than Â£35,772,006, and it has increased
rather than decreased since then. Several steamers
have plied daily since 1860 between Shanghai and
Hankow, and some three thousand vessels, one-half
of which are British, enter the port every year.
Silk and tea are the chief exports, after which
come cotton, rice, sugar, paper, tobacco, various
drugs used as medicines, cloth of native manufacture,
wool, hemp, flower-seeds, fans, and other
fancy articles." The chief imports from abroad are
cotton goods, alcohol, opium, which is fortunately
rapidly declining in amount, various metals, and
woollen stuffs. In 1896, France, whose trade with
China takes third rank amongst that of European
nations, England coming first and then Germany,
exported goods to the value of one hundred and
eighty-four millions of francs, on which she paid
one million five hundred thousand francs duty. To
set against this, French imports to China, including
woven materials, lace, wine, copper, and other
goods, amounted to the value of twenty-eight
millions only; that is to say, one hundred and
fifty-six millions less than the exports. What an
immense difference does this sum represent between
what China gave and what she received, and what a
price the Chinese paid for the privilege of dealing
with the West! To this day the Celestials, whose
ports have been opened against their will by the
cannon of the British, aided by those of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
French, give what they must give to foreigners
grudgingly; to use an expressive saying, there is
no love lost between them and those they trade
with. They would like to take all and give nothing
in return. Those who are unfortunate enough to
die abroad will not allow their dust to aid in
fructifying the soil of the land of their exile, for
their bodies are brought by steamers from San
Francisco, Peru, the Philippine Islands, Australia,
and elsewhere, to be buried in their native land,
in the same last resting-place as that of their
ancestors, where their memory will be held sacred
by their own descendants. There is indeed something
very pathetic and touching in the intense
devotion of the Chinese to their native land, in
spite of their ignorant readiness to leave it. They
will make any sacrifice to ensure burial at home,
for they believe that there alone can the dead find
true repose.</p>

<p>When I was at Shanghai, I noted with some
surprise what immense quantities of bales of
cotton were landed at the port. An Englishman
with whom I had some conversation told me these
bales came from the East Indies, and that the
amount imported was continually on the increase.
The Chinese aspire, he added, to manufacturing
cotton goods themselves, and if they should
succeed in overcoming their aversion to European
methods of production, the trade in stuffs will
receive a severe blow. It is, however, greatly in
favour of British manufacturing interests that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Western China is not suitable to the cultivation
of the raw material, so that the cotton for making
much of the clothing of the natives has all to be
brought from abroad. "Every traveller in the
Upper Yang-tse," says Little in his <i>Through the
Yang-tse Gorges</i>, "is struck by the endless procession
of cotton-laden junks struggling up the
successive rapids."</p>

<div class="sidenote">YELLOW PERIL FOR THE FUTURE</div>

<p>A more significant sign of the times and of the
emancipation of many of the Chinese from the
trammels of tradition, even than the desire to
produce their clothes at home, is the willingness
of traders and merchants to settle in foreign towns.
Not so very long ago the only Chinese met with
in Europe or America were the coolies who had
emigrated on the conditions described in a previous
chapter. Now in London, in Paris, and in New
York are extensive depÃ´ts of tea, silk, and other
exports from the Celestial Empire kept by Chinese
men of wealth, with a staff of their own yellow
countrymen. This fact represents the true yellow
peril for European and American merchants, for
these merchants sell better goods at lower prices
than their foreign rivals, and the employers of
labour will presently have to contend in their own
persons with a competition as keen and as unequal
as that hampering their workmen. The fact that
the Chinese will work for very much lower wages
than those on which any white man can support life,
has long been a problem for those responsible for
municipal government in the States, but it is only
lately that the monied classes have been, so to
speak, threatened with a similar danger in their
own strongholds of trade and commerce. If restrictions
are not soon imposed upon the entry
into Paris and other great cities of Europe of these
formidable rivals, we may yet in our own life-time
see the yellow-skins driven through the streets
before the bayonet and the revolver in our capitals,
in much the same fashion as they already have
been in California and Australia. But when all is
said and done, have not Asiatics just as much
right to rejoice in the sunshine, such as it is, of the
West as Europeans have to bask in that of the East?
Is not the life of a Tartar, a Mongol, or a Mandarin
really as sacred as that of a native of France or of
England? It all depends on the point of view.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN INVITATION TO DINNER</div>

<p>A wealthy American, who had been longer at
Shanghai than any other foreigner, invited me to
dine with him at a celebrated Chinese restaurant,
and there I enjoyed the rare privilege of meeting
several natives of high rank. They came accompanied
by their favourite concubines, their
legal wives being left at home; and the ladies
were carried in their palanquins right into the
centre of the dining-room, where they got out.
Dressed in fresh and elegant costumes of light blue
silk, and with their abundant black hair decked
with natural flowers, they really looked very
pretty. Their complexions, though far too much
rouged, were delicate; and where the natural hue
had been left unchanged, almost white. Sitting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
at table with them, I regretted very much that I
could not say a word they would understand, for
they spoke neither French nor English, and I do
not understand Chinese. My host had, however,
warned me to be very careful not to be too polite
to them even in dumb-show, for if their lords felt
the very smallest spark of jealousy I should most
likely see all the fair creatures take flight like a
flock of frightened turtle-doves. Their palanquins
were waiting outside at the door of the restaurant,
ready for every contingency. The Celestials invited
had only consented to come to this dinner
when they were assured that I should be leaving
Shanghai in a few days. Throughout the meal
the women talked very little amongst themselves,
but I saw a smile of amusement on their lips
when they noticed my embarrassment at having
to take something to which I was not accustomed;
such as pigeons' hearts with ginger, to drink spirit
distilled from rice out of little cups instead of
glasses, and to pick up my food with the ivory
chop-sticks, which did duty for forks. None of
the ladies ate any meat, and they put nothing into
their dainty mouths but perfumed sweets or dried
melon-seeds, which they picked up with their long,
slim fingers, disfigured by great claw-like nails,
giving their hands a very unpleasant, almost bestial
appearance. The meal consisted of three courses,
during the serving of which vocal and instrumental
music&mdash;oh, such a lot of it!&mdash;was going on. When
it was over, the young women rose, and, still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
smiling, made their way out with difficulty on their
poor deformed feet, clutching at the table, the
chairs, and the walls for support as they limped to
their luxurious palanquins. The last to leave had
feet so tiny I could hardly see them beneath her
jonquil-coloured silk breeches. I remarked on the
small size of the poor girl's feet to a corpulent
Celestial with an intelligent face who was sitting
beside me, and he said with a loud laugh, "Very
good thing for jealous husbands!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">A BARBAROUS CUSTOM</div>

<p>"Small feet are not merely a caprice of fashion
then?" I observed.</p>

<p>"No, no!" was the reply. "The fact is, when in
any family, whether rich or poor, a girl-child is
born, who is well formed and has good features,
giving great promise of beauty when she is fifteen
years old, her feet are subjected to close compression
a few months after birth. You will understand
that it is her liberty to walk or run, and to get out
of the house, which is taken away from her at this
early stage of her existence.... Later, when her
parents, if wealthy, wish to find a good match for
her, or if poor are anxious to sell her for a high
price, her small feet are always quoted as a proof
of her value, and this privation of liberty is considered
a great point in her favour ... do you see?"</p>

<p>"What a barbarous custom!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes, from the European point of view, but if
you had asked any of the girls who were at dinner
just now, whether Hatai, Atma, Atoi, or Atchai,
each one would have replied that she did not regret
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the life that she leads. If she had not been prepared
in this way to be bought by some wealthy
Celestial, she would have been working in the rice-plantations
like a beast of burden; or would have
had to spend her life with the fisher-folk on the
sea-shore, or in some wretched river-boat."</p>

<p>"How are these sales of women effected?" I
inquired.</p>

<p>"Through the agency of brokers, and by formal
contract. At this moment I have a document in
my pocket making me the owner from to-day of a
young girl of Tien-tsin. Would you like to see it?"</p>

<p>Of course I said yes, and he showed me the
contract, of which I give a verbatim translation:</p>

<div class="sidenote">POLYGAMY IN CHINA</div>

<p>Having read and copied this document, I returned it to the
owner, with the remark, "So you
can have as many women as it suits you to buy.
In Egypt, where polygamy seems as natural as it
does to you, there is some limit put upon the
number of favourites in a harem, as the purchaser
must prove that he is rich enough to support her
before he is allowed to buy a new wife. How is
it with you?"</p>

<p>"There is no similar restriction in China," was
the reply. "Besides the women we buy, more as
a gratification to our pride than because we have
taken a fancy to them, there is the wife whom you
in Europe would call the legitimate partner. She
is privileged above all the other women owned by
a man, and her children alone have the right of
inheriting the property of their father. We must
have heirs to succeed us, and this is why we have
no scruple in repudiating a barren wife. The
first of our other women to give us a male child
takes the place of the divorced wife, and the rest
follow suit, until we are sure of having quite a
number of sons to honour our memories when we
are gone, just as I have honoured that of my own
father. You must not forget how very strong
tradition is with us, and that which we are now discussing
dates further back than your own Biblical
age. All innovation is displeasing to us.... A few
years ago the friend who gave us a dinner this
evening, put me into communication with a Protestant
clergyman, who had just arrived from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
England, and was consumed with a desire to make
proselytes. Out of politeness, I listened for several
days to what he had to say, and I even accepted
the gift of a Bible from him. I set to work to read
it with the greatest attention. To begin with, I
was very much surprised to find how young the
world was made out to be in it, for I had learnt
from our bonzes that at the time when Abraham
was born, China was already old&mdash;very, very old&mdash;so
I put the Bible aside. Was I not right, seeing
that it taught me nothing new?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied, "you should have read on till
you came to the New Testament, for in it you
would have found that man is not meant to live in
a state of debasing immobility, and that woman
has a very different mission to fulfil than that of
the mere beast of burden, or concubine you make of
her in China."</p>

<p>Fortunately, perhaps, for the conversation was
becoming rather acrimonious, our host interrupted
us by inviting us to go with him to a <i>fÃ©te</i> which
was being given in the harbour by a mandarin
friend of his, a great opium-smoker, and owner of
what in the Celestial Empire by a chivalrous
euphemism is called a "Flower Boat."</p>

<div class="sidenote">ON A FLOWER BOAT</div>

<p>A few vigorous strokes from the oars of our
boatmen brought us alongside a junk riding at
anchor in the open roadstead of Shanghai. The
interior, draped with scarlet damask, was brilliantly
illuminated by means of an immense number of
dainty little lanterns, beneath which hung cages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
filled with birds, whilst other cages upheld glass
globes where red fish, with long golden tails and
transparent fins, disported themselves, their size
fantastically exaggerated by the medium through
which we watched their graceful movements. Very
finely-woven mats of gleaming cleanliness covered
the floors, and curtains of embroidered silk slightly
raised hung at the entrances to the cabins, half
concealing, half revealing, the mysterious recesses
within. I went into one of these retreats, and there
in the centre of the room I saw seated round a
table, loaded with flowers, a number of pale-faced
Chinamen, each with a fan in his hand, with
several richly-dressed women (all, as usual, too much
rouged), who were sipping tea together or nibbling
sweetmeats to the accompaniment of a guitar. I
noted also a couch of satin, without mattress or
palliasse, but with a pillow consisting of a cylinder
of red chequered cardboard, and not far from the
couch a fragile bamboo table, on which were placed
a metal pipe, a box of opium, and the little lamps
indispensable to the smokers of the drug.</p>

<p>I was presented to the mandarin, who was giving
the entertainment, and found him to be a man of
very dignified appearance. He had lived for a long
time at Hong-Kong, and spoke a little English.
He was very anxious to perform his duties of host
properly with regard to me, but did not find it very
easy.</p>

<p>"What will you take?" he and the gentleman
who had brought me kept saying one after the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>A queer fancy took possession of me all of a
sudden, and I replied that I should like to smoke
some opium.</p>

<p>"Well, then," was the answer, "will you go into
that cabin?" He clapped his hands, and a servant
ran in to light the lamps.</p>

<p>When this was done, my host said: "I will send
you a little tea as well, in case the opium should not
suit you. I suppose it is the first time you have
ever smoked it."</p>

<p>The tea was placed ready to my hand, and I was
left alone, the curtain falling as the servant retired.
I then smoked my first pipe, and found the flavour
of it detestably nasty. I now stretched myself in
the couch, laid my head upon the hard glazed roll
of cardboard, which did duty as a pillow, and closed
my eyes. After a few minutes of anything but
pleasant meditation, I suddenly felt very unwell,
and looked about me distractedly. Seeing a porthole
close to me, I put my head through it, hoping
that the fresh air would cool my burning forehead,
but the sight of the black water of the harbour, and
the dreary sound of its surging up and down, made
me worse, so I quickly drew back and lay down
again, determined to persevere. At the end of a
quarter of an hour I had smoked two more pipes,
and then I issued from my cabin with a very vague
idea about my own sensations, but feeling like a
man suddenly overtaken by giddiness, or seized
with violent sea-sickness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A HAPPY DREAM</div>

<p>My Yankee friend hastened to my assistance,
but before he saw me off the boat, he took me to
have a look at the stout Chinaman with whom I
had had a discussion about the Bible. He was
alone in a smoking-den, just like the one I had
used. His face was ghastly pale, his eyes were
widely distended, and he was gazing at the waves
with an expression of terror, whilst his features
were bathed in perspiration.... He was wrapt
in a dream&mdash;a happy dream, no doubt&mdash;though his
looks belied it, for surely so many Asiatics would
not smoke the opium which brings the dreams if
they were not happy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Opium</span> has from the first been so important a
factor in the history of Western intercourse with
China, and indulgence in it is said to have had so
much to do with the physical and mental inferiority
of the modern Celestials, that it will be well to
devote a chapter to the consideration of the nature
of the drug and its effects.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CULTIVATION OF THE POPPY</div>

<p>The poppy (<i>papaver somniferum</i>), from which
the narcotic is extracted, is grown in Persia and in
China, but it is in India that it is most largely and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
successfully cultivated. The monopoly of producing
it in her great Eastern dependency, and of
selling it to the Chinese, has always been vigorously
protected by England, and the destruction of that
monopoly when it comes will be an immense loss
to the revenue. Opium is, in fact, to the English
what tobacco is to the French, and there is no
doubt that British missionary effort has been
greatly hampered by the dread of the authorities
of any interference with their lucrative trade.</p>

<p>In the vast and fertile valley of the Ganges, the
poppy has but to be sown to yield an extensive
crop. The Patna and Benares districts are especially
prolific, and at the time of efflorescence the
air is laden with the heavy, enervating scent from
the flowers. Nothing could be much more dreary
and monotonous than the appearance of an Indian
poppy plantation, when the soil is covered with
the dried petals of the flower. Some few years
ago the tax on the exported drug, both from
Calcutta and from Bombay, amounted to considerably
over six millions of pounds. The cultivators
take their produce to the Government factories,
where it is purchased from them, and then sent to
the sea-port, so that any illicit consumption is
rendered almost impossible. The comparatively
small amount of opium consumed in India itself
is taxed by the excise officers, and the bulk of the
crop finds its way to China. It is only of late
years that native opium has competed at all with
Indian, but already it is rumoured that eventually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
it will drive the foreign imports away altogether.
Szechuan opium is taking the place of Indian on
the Yang-tse, and Little, in his <i>Through the Yang-tse
Gorges</i>, describes vast poppy plantations in
the districts watered by the great river. He
bemoans the association of the English name
"with the introduction of the useful yet pernicious
drug," and points out that it was first brought to
China from India by the Portuguese, adding that,
in any case, the opium-pipe is most surely a
Chinese invention, for it is unknown in any other
land.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PREPARATION OF OPIUM</div>

<p>Opium in its first state is the dried juice of the
capsules before they are ripe, and is gathered in
the form of little globules of milky sap, of the
colour of amber. In India the seed is sown early
in November, and the capsules are ready for
piercing about the beginning of February, when
they are nearly as large as hen's eggs. The delicate
operation of opening the poppy-heads for the
exudation of the precious fluid is performed with
an instrument about three inches long, consisting
of four small knives bound together, the edges
looking like the teeth of a comb. The labourers
have each several of these instruments, which, when
not in use, they carry carefully in a case. The day
after the capsules have been pierced, the juice is
collected by scraping it off into a kind of scoop,
or small trowel, whence it is transferred to an
earthen pot, hanging from the collector's side
When full, these pots are carefully covered over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and carried to the gatherer's home. The contents
of the jar require the most careful attention for
three or four weeks to ensure proper and equal
drying. The juice is poured into a shallow plate
or dish of brass, slightly tilted, to let any watery
fluid, which would spoil the drug, drain off, and
when the process is complete, the opium is carefully
packed in jars of equal size, and taken to
the Government factories. Here it is carefully
examined, chemically tested, and weighed, to make
sure that it has not been tampered with in any
way; and, if all is well, it is placed in pots of the
regulation size: the pots are ticketed and ranged
in rows on shelves in a big room set apart for the
purpose. The rest of the preparation for export is
done in the Government laboratories, and the process
is a long and delicate one. The united crops
of vast districts are thrown into large tubs, where
they are kneaded up together till they are of the
right consistency. The material is then taken out,
divided into equal portions, and placed on small
tables, where it is manipulated, with the aid of
copper bowls of a spherical shape, into balls of an
equal weight, of about the size of a man's head.
Some workmen become so skilful that they turn
out a hundred of these balls a day. Poppy-leaves,
reduced to powder, are used to prevent the opium
from sticking together, and the balls are sprinkled
with the powder, much as chemists used to sprinkle
pills.</p>

<p>The opium thus prepared, is now placed in great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
earthenware pans, and carried to a drying-room,
where the balls are ranged in rows of mathematical
regularity. During the drying process each sphere
is pierced every now and then with a long needle,
to prevent the fermentation, which, but for the
greatest vigilance, might set in. The pricking also
sets free the gas which would rapidly deteriorate
the value of the drug, prevents it from becoming
musty, and drives off the swarms of insects attracted
by the smell from it.</p>

<p>The cases in which the balls of opium are packed
are made of wood from the mountains of Nepaul,
which is brought to its destination in the form of
huge rafts. These rafts come down the Ganges
on sailing vessels, at the approach of which all
other crafts have to make way. Calcutta is the
port of export for Bengal, and the opium is
shipped into steamers and taken to Hong-Kong or
Shanghai.</p>

<p>As is well known, the British Government has
been very severely criticized, not only by foreigners,
but by English philanthropists, for maintaining the
opium monopoly, and the entire cessation of the
trade from India is earnestly advocated. Those
who wish to maintain things as they are, urge that
the control exercised by the authorities is a beneficent
one, and that but for it opium would be
cultivated throughout the whole of India, and its
consumption increased a thousand-fold. Time, the
great equalizer, will no doubt in the end keep up
the monopoly without any definite action on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
part of the English, for although nominally forbidden,
the culture of the poppy is encouraged in
China by the officials responsible for the enforcement
of the law, and immense quantities of opium
of native production is sold in the western provinces,
for a much lower price than the imported
drug.</p>

<p>The opium of Bengal is still preferred by critical
smokers, but that of Smyrna is more largely used
in medicine, for it contains a greater proportion
of morphine, and is sent in large quantities to
England, and to Belgium. The culture of the
poppy has of late years also been tried in Africa,
Australia, and even in parts of America, but so far
the opium produced in those countries does not
compete with the Asiatic to any perceptible degree.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OPIUM SMUGGLING</div>

<p>As a very little opium represents a considerable
money value, smuggling is of course practised on
a very large scale, especially in China, where the
ingenuity displayed is really extraordinary. All
along the coast, and that coast is of immense
extent, the illicit trade is briskly carried on. In
the South the smuggled drug is brought in in very
fleet vessels, of light tonnage, which easily evade
the boats of the revenue officers. The steamers
plying daily between the open ports of Hong-Kong
and Canton do much to help the traffic, for the
Celestials, who take passage on them, secrete the
precious drug about their own persons in a
manner most difficult to detect. Quantities of
opium are also often hidden beneath sham planks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
in the paddles of the wheels, in the pipes of the
fire-engines, and even in the clocks on board. The
struggle between the smugglers and the custom-house
officers is never-ending, and the skill displayed
in concealment on the one side and detection
on the other is so nearly equal, that it is rare
indeed for either to gain a decisive victory over
the other.</p>

<p>There is something truly pathetic in the futile
efforts made at various times by the Chinese
Government to prevent the importation of opium
into the country, and of the many viceroys of
provinces to keep it out of the districts under their
care. Here is a typical proclamation, issued by a
certain Wang in the early days of the trade in the
pernicious drug, which gives a very fair idea of
what may be called native administrative literature:</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EVIL E-JEN</div>

<p>"Wang, Imperial Viceroy, makes known the
following: Advices have reached us to the effect
that in the capital of Kwang-Tung and the neighbouring
districts certain E-jen (barbarians from
the West) are going about distributing to the
people drugs in the form of pills made by fairies
and evil genii. It is asserted that those who have
absorbed these drugs sweat terribly all over their
bodies to such an extent that they die.</p>

<p>"I order all civil and military authorities to seek
out the distributors of these diabolical medicines,
to arrest them, and to bring them to the Court
of Justice, where I will punish them severely.
Although there are no proofs that in my own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
district the E-jen have ventured to sell the pills in
question, I have been assured that cakes injurious
to health have been distributed to the people.
Analyzed with the aid of white of egg, these cakes
yielded a residue of maggots.... I immediately
ordered the arrest of the presumptuous merchants,
but they had already fled beyond my jurisdiction.
Fifty strokes from a bamboo-rod on the soles of
their feet would have been their punishment. The
fact is, I am very much afraid that these wretches
have gone to other provinces, there to carry on
their trade and do further mischief.</p>

<p>"From another report I learn that every day
certain E-jen throw deadly poisonous powders
upon the roads; the rain does not destroy their
potency for evil; when these powders are trodden
under foot a thin, suffocating smoke rises up from
them; there are some E-jen who carry this pernicious
substance at the end of their fingers, and
they have but to rub the head of any one they
meet with it for that person to die, his body
becoming covered with red spots.</p>

<p>"Have a care, therefore, not to allow yourselves
to be duped; I give you notice that at the gates
of the town in which I reside I have posted policemen
who examine all strangers."</p>

<p>In 1578 the celebrated Chinese savant, Li-Shi-Shen,
published his great book on the materials
employed in medicine, to which he had devoted
his whole life. In this book he gives the history
of the poppy and its cultivation, dividing that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
history into three parts, the first relating to the
early days when its properties were little known,
that is to say, from the eighth to the eleventh
century; the second to the time when the juice
of the capsules was discovered to have medicinal
properties and became used to alleviate affections
of the stomach; and the third when opium was
imported in solid form. Li-Shi-Shen justly remarks
that it is in the capsule or seed-pod that the opium
juice is secreted, and he recommends the use of
that juice mixed with honey for certain maladies.
He makes fun of a doctor who lived before his
time, and had said that the juice of the poppy
could kill as surely as a stroke from a sword, but
dwells on the immense relief which those suffering
from rheumatism and asthma had obtained from
its use. This sage of the sixteenth century adds,
that in Pekin opium pills are used to arouse sexual
passion. There is nothing surprising in this assertion
to those who know the Chinese and their
fondness for such queer diet as swallows' nests,
ginger, the fins of sharks, sea-urchins, etc., because
they think they stimulate the senses. It must,
however, be added in justice to the Celestials, that
they are far less sensual than their neighbours, the
Japanese, and this is no small praise.</p>

<p>Though Li-Shi-Shen was right in laughing at
the doctor whose assertion is quoted above, the
abuse of the newly-discovered drug of opium did
cause a great many deaths, and in the seventeenth
century many Imperial edicts were issued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
forbidding its use, but so deeply rooted had the love
of it become, that these fulminations against it
were powerless to prevent its importation. The
mortality was doubled when the Chinese learnt
to mix opium with Hashish, or the potent drug
known in India as bhang, prepared from hemp.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A PERNICIOUS MIXTURE</div>

<p>The fatal knowledge was imparted to the
Celestials in 1625 by some Batavians who had
come to Formosa, then in the possession of the
Dutch, who were engaged in building Fort Zealandia,
near the present Taiwan. The pernicious
compound is smoked through a pipe fixed on to
a bamboo handle, and those who indulge in it are
thrown into a state of delirium, which generally
lasts for a whole night. The results in the island
of Formosa were immediate and tragic, for all who
had once enjoyed the voluptuous dreams induced
by the double narcotic, conceived such a passion
for the poison that no restrictive measures had any
effect. The Dutch, alarmed at the rapid depopulation
of the island, did their best to remedy the
evil, but it was all of no use, the union of opium
and Hashish was more devastating than an epidemic
of cholera or small-pox would have been.
If a native were condemned to the bastinado he
would beg to be allowed to smoke his pipe whilst
the punishment was being inflicted, and the blows
from the bamboo fell all unheeded on his shoulders.
According to some accounts it was this demoralization
of the natives which led the Dutch to abandon
Formosa, whilst others say they were driven out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
in 1866 by the Chinese. In any case it seems
pretty certain that the worst form of opium smoking
began during the Dutch occupation of Formosa,
and was thence introduced to the mainland. It
is consoling to know that Chinese historians
attribute to the Dutch, not the English, the introduction
of the most pernicious of all the various
forms of opium smoking.</p>

<p>Inspired probably more by hatred of the
foreigners who became enriched by the importation
of the drug than by any feeling of humanity,
the Chinese authorities continued for two whole
centuries to inflict all manner of punishments on
those who smoked opium, no matter in what form.
The offenders were fined, thrown into prison, compelled
to wear the cangue, or heavy wooden collar,
fitting closely round the neck and preventing the
victim from obtaining any rest, or received a varying
number of strokes from the bamboo on the
mouth or on the soles of the feet. Now, however,
all is changed, for the tax imposed on opium brings
wealth to the coffers of the Government, and
although smoking is still nominally forbidden, it
is in reality encouraged throughout the length and
breadth of the land.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHINESE PRISONS</div>

<p>Opinion is very much divided as to the effect of
opium on those who indulge in it. When I was
in Indo-China I was only able to consult English
doctors on the subject, and it was impossible not
to feel that they were necessarily prejudiced in
favour of the drug, bearing in mind the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
revenues reaped by their Government from its
importation. I was assured by one of them that
its use in moderation was perfectly harmless, and
that an old confirmed smoker if suddenly deprived
of it, does not suffer any ill effects. This, by the
way, is a very important point. My informants
cited cases of ardent consumers of opium being
thrown into prison, where such a thing as a pipe
was not to be had; yet instead of suffering from
the deprivation, the victims retained their usual
health, and were not nearly so much affected as
sailors would be who could not have the tobacco
to which they are accustomed, or drunkards cut
off from every beverage but pure water. It will
be remembered that after the suppression of the
Commune in France in 1871, many of the insurgents
sent to Brest died at once from the sudden
loss of the stimulants they had become accustomed
to. More hardened or more philosophical, who
shall say which? the Chinese prisoners deprived
of their best-beloved pastime resign themselves
without a murmur, though there is no doubt that
they suffer frightfully from the terrible conditions
in the gaols, coming out, if they come out alive,
mere skeletons. A "Celestial" place of detention
is indeed a Gehenna of horror and misery. It is
only fair to add, however, that a case occurred of
a man, who before he was sent to prison had never
missed his pipe for thirty years, yet he gained
three pounds in weight during the first three weeks
of his detention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>Amongst the poorer classes in China it is really
the time and money wasted on the drug which are
of more importance to the bread-winner than the
bad effect on his health. At the best of times the
wages earned by a Chinese labourer are extremely
low, and when he takes to smoking, his wife and
children suffer much, as do those of drunkards in
Europe. Archibald Little, who knows the Celestials
as well perhaps as any other Englishman, says
that during his "forty years' stay in the country
and extensive intercourse with every class, he has
met with few natives seriously injured by the drug.
To the well-nourished Chinaman," he adds, "his
evening pipes are more a pastime, a means of
passing the time pleasantly in a state of placid
inactivity dear to the Oriental, while the merchant
conducts many of his best bargains over the pipe,
much as negotiations are often conducted over a
bottle of wine at home.... It is when," adds this
keen observer, "a Chinese mandarin succumbs to
the opium-pipe and spends most of his time on
the opium-couch that the mischief is serious, for
rapacity and mis-government go on unchecked,"<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
it being all but impossible to get such a man
removed from his post. He has, say the natives,
the 'Yin,' their name for the passionate craving
for the drug, corresponding with what is called
dipsomania by European doctors, and there is no
hope for him; he will indulge his passion till he
dies. Not unjustly have many medical men called
attention to the indulgence in wine and brandy
of the European residents in China, especially in
Hong-Kong, and suggested that the missionaries
should begin their reforms at home, and before
inveighing against Chinese vices they should
endeavour to win converts to sobriety amongst
their own fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>In discussing the evil effects of opium-smoking,
the very great value of the drug as a medicine is
liable to be forgotten, yet the lives of thousands
have been saved by its use under proper control.
It has absolutely no rival in its power of giving
needful sleep in illness and in relieving pain, whilst
in many diseases its effect is of the greatest possible
advantage to the patient.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE 'BLACK SMOKE'</div>

<p>Dr. Ayres of Hong-Kong relates several experiments
he made in his own person to test the
truth of the theory that the poisonous qualities of
opium evaporate when it is smoked, but remain
active when it is eaten. He began by absorbing
a very small quantity per day till he could take
as much as half-an-ounce, and says that he experienced
sensations so intensely agreeable that
he realized what the suffering of deprivation must be
when the habit of opium-eating is once confirmed.
He then tried smoking a pipe of the prepared
drug every day, without feeling any ill effects whatever;
there was, he declares, absolutely no difference
in his pulse or in his temperature. It was exactly
the same with several Europeans whom he persuaded
to follow his example. "I counted the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
throbs of their pulse, I took their temperature, and
there was absolutely nothing abnormal about either,
although I had made them smoke twelve pipes
each." This does but prove that the effects of
opium are different with different constitutions,
and that there are some who can take it even in
large quantities with impunity; but for all that the
horrors of the so-called black smoke, and of the
opium dens of China can hardly be exaggerated,
even the Celestials themselves admitting that the
effects of the drug are injurious to health, and
warp the better nature of those who indulge in it
to excess; but, as already remarked, its price is
still so high that only the wealthy can afford it
in quantities likely to be hurtful. It is as difficult
for a Chinese workman to get opium as it would
be for a French peasant to buy champagne, or
an English apprentice to indulge in port-wine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SOCIABLE SMOKERS</div>

<p>Moreover, it is even now the exception for rich
Celestials to yield themselves body and soul to the
temptation. One opium-smoker goes to call on
another, and the two indulge in a friendly pipe
together as they chat about the weather, or the
state of trade, or perhaps arrange a marriage for
a son or a daughter; but the host does not expect
to see his guest fall asleep and roll on the ground
like a pig, any more than a European now-a-days
expects his visitor to succumb to drink, and slip
under the table as was so common an occurrence
at the beginning of the nineteenth century. The
ordinary opium-smoker does not light his pipe to
induce sleep, but just to enable him to forget his
troubles for a time, and no De Quincey or Sylvestre
de Sacy is needed to prove that a man in rags
may indulge in happy dreams of prosperity without
leaving some cheap and dingy tavern. Still
we cannot fail to contrast the ugly Chinese apparatus
with all its paraphernalia, including the horribly
smelling lamp needed to keep it alight, with the
simple European pipe, so easily filled to begin
with, and so readily replenished. The lover of
opium seeks to be alone; he has no desire for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
company of even his dearest friend in his den;
but the smoker of the comparatively innocent weed
delights in gathering his comrades about him, and
there is nothing in the wide world more provocative
of good fellowship than the fumes of tobacco.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is no more pathetic, no more thrilling

of missionary effort in China, and those who
remember the sad fate of the French Sisters at
Tien-tsin, and of many other devoted women, will
not fail to accord their tribute of admiration to
the noble devotion which has inspired so many to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
lay down their lives in the sacred cause of the
propagation of the Gospel in the Celestial Empire.
That the crop of proselytes yielded by a soil
fructified with the blood of virgin martyrs is altogether
out of proportion to the expenditure of life
and money involved in winning them, is indeed
a melancholy fact; but undaunted by the terrors
of the past, fresh bands of eager zealots are ever
ready to take the place of those worsted in the
struggle, and at the present moment there seems
hope that the religion of the Redeemer may yet
take real root in the districts newly opened to
European trade.</p>

<p>As is well known, it was the Jesuits who were
the first to succeed in introducing Christianity into
China. Far more enlightened and worldly-wise
than the monks of the rival orders, they obtained a
footing where so many others had failed, by their
tact in giving out that they were pilgrims from
the West who had heard of the wonders of the
Celestial Empire, and had come to it to see those
wonders with their own eyes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A MISSIONARY PIONEER</div>

<p>The pioneer of these astute followers of Ignatius
Loyola was a certain Michael Roger, who landed
in China in 1581, and although some of his
successors were beheaded in 1615 the work they
had done bore fruit in the erection of a church
at Kei-Fung-Fu, on the Yellow River, in which
quite a number of converts attended the Roman
Catholic services. This church was destroyed
through the bursting of a dyke, and the Jesuit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
missionary then in charge of it was drowned in
trying to save his little flock. In spite of this
catastrophe, however, the Jesuits continued to gain
ground, and during the reign of the Emperor
Shun-Che, who occupied the throne from 1644 to
1662, China was actually for some little time
governed by Adam Schaal, a member of that
community, who had been made Chief Minister
of State on account of his wisdom. Another
Jesuit, Father Ferdinand Verbiest, held a high
astronomical appointment, for then as now the
heavenly bodies were studied with intense eagerness
in the Celestial Empire, and many officers of
State were specially told off to report on everything
connected with them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PUERILE DISPUTES</div>

<p>The successor of Shun-Che, his son Kang-Hi,
who was only eight years old when he came to
the throne, showed special aptitude for astronomy,
and was never tired of listening to the instructions
of Father Verbiest. As he grew older he worked
with him and the other missionaries at geometry
and the kindred sciences, gaining year by year in
scientific knowledge. It was during his reign that
the Jesuit missionaries, Bouvet, Regis, Fartoux,
Fridelli, Cardoso, and others, made their celebrated
survey of the whole of China on trigometrical
principles, which is still looked upon as
absolutely correct by geographers, and there is
little doubt that had the gifted young Emperor
been left entirely under the guidance of these
enlightened fathers, they would, through the door
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
opened by science, have introduced Christianity,
or rather their form of Christianity, throughout the
entire Empire. During the minority of Kang-Hi,
however, the four ministers appointed to govern
the country did all in their power to counteract
the influence of the foreigners, and restore all the
old-established customs. Their efforts were aided
by the fact that monks belonging to other orders
had now established themselves here and there in
the country, and between them and the Jesuits a
bitter feud was waged as to the way in which
Christian worship should be performed, and the
meaning of certain Chinese words. To give but
one or two instances of the puerile nature of the
quarrel which jeopardized the cause that should
have been sacred to all the disputants, one side
claimed that the word <i>Chang-ti</i> signified the
material heaven, the other that it referred to the
God inhabiting heaven; one side considered the
honour shown to ancestors and the reverence in
which the doctrines of Confucius are held to be
religious duties, whilst the other looked upon them
as mere civil or political customs. That it was
of little consequence which was right was patent
to any but the most prejudiced observer, yet
the foolish monks referred their differences for
arbitration to the Pope and the Emperor. The
former decided in favour of the Dominicans,
the latter in that of the Jesuits, and the Chinese
literati not unreasonably asked how the missionaries
could expect to be listened to by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
natives if they could not agree amongst themselves.</p>

<p>All might, however, even yet have been well,
and the Jesuits might have continued their education
of the young Emperor had not the Pope
unfortunately sent a legate to Pekin charged with
the difficult task of making the Jesuits conform to
the views of their opponents. This roused the
wrath and jealousy of the Emperor, who, of
course, knew nothing about the Pope, and did
more to undermine the power of his hitherto
trusted advisers than anything else could have
done. He had, he said, allowed Christianity to be
preached just as he had had other religions, but
only on condition that the moral precepts inculcated
by the first philosopher of the country, and
accepted by all the most enlightened amongst his
people, were left unquestioned, yet here was an
envoy sent from some unknown land with instructions
to tamper with the belief of his subjects.
An Imperial edict was therefore issued in 1706,
ordering the expulsion of all missionaries without
distinction of sect; the Christian churches were
desecrated and destroyed, and all natives who had
embraced the new doctrine were persecuted with
the utmost severity, fined, imprisoned, and in some
cases put to death. Then the Pope from his
distant throne in Rome sent yet another legate,
bearing a letter protesting in the strongest terms
against these severe measures, but Kang-Hi, who
certainly had considerable reason on his side, called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
his notables together, and having informed them of
the contents of the Holy Father's missive exclaimed:
"This epistle ignores every one but these vile
Europeans, yet how can they decide anything
about the great doctrine of the Chinese, whose very
language these people from Europe do not understand?
From the way these Christians behave, it
strikes me that there is some resemblance between
the practices of their sect and those of certain
impious bonzes of our own land. We must now
forbid Europeans from preaching their faith
amongst us if we wish to prevent the recurrence
of disagreeable events." The division of the sexes
until after marriage was then, as now, one of the
most rigidly-observed customs of the Celestials, and
it is probable that the "evil practices" referred to
in the speech quoted above, were the meeting of
men and women for worship in the same building.
This was more shocking to Chinese public opinion
than anything else, and may have had something
to do with this final failure of missionary effort.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A CHINESE DICTIONARY</div>

<p>Kang-Hi was, there is no doubt, a very enlightened
ruler, and, moreover, himself a writer of considerable
talent. He compiled a dictionary of the Chinese
and Manchu dialects, translated the five sacred
books of China into the Tartar language, and
wrote many interesting essays on various subjects.
Moreover it was thanks to his initiative, that a
very complete Chinese dictionary was produced by
thirty of the chief literati of his time.</p>

<p>Kang-Hi, who, in spite of the fulmination of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
great edict against the Christians, still in his heart
cherished a strong affection for the Jesuits, who
had won his love through the interest they had
taken in his favourite pursuits, was succeeded by
his son, Young-t-Ching who inherited none of his
father's sympathy for Europeans, and persecuted
the Christians with the utmost severity. His
advisers represented to him, "that the missionaries
had deceived the late Emperor, and that the
monarch had lost a great deal of <i>prestige</i> by his
encouragement of the Jesuits." Moreover, the
viceroys of outlying provinces sent accounts of the
iniquities of the converts to the new faith in their
districts, the governor of Fu-Kian distinguishing
himself especially by the bitterness of his rancour
against them. He begged the Emperor in the
interests of his people to banish all foreigners
without distinction to Macao, then already occupied
by the Portuguese.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A WISE EMPEROR</div>

<p>It was, however, fortunately for the Chinese as
well as for the foreigners, one thing to issue these
sweeping denunciations, and another to have them
fully carried out. Europeans were too useful at
the Court of Pekin for the Emperor to be willing to
part with them all, and he naÃ¯vely decided to keep
those about him who were of any service to him,
but to banish the rest. The missionaries of the
capital who were thus reprieved, hoped to win help
for their colleagues of the provinces by writing to
a brother of the Emperor, who they believed to be
favourable to them, and they received the following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
disinterested reply: "We have no intention of
imitating your way of going on in Europe; your
disputes about our customs have done you a great
deal of harm, and China will miss nothing when
you are no longer there." Moreover the Emperor
added a postscript to this letter, which ran thus:
"What would you say if I sent a troop of Buddhist
priests into your country? When your Father
Ricci was here there were only a few of you; you
had not then disciples and churches in all the
provinces. It was only during the reign of my
father that you increased with such rapidity; we
saw it then, but we did not dare say anything
about it. If, however, you deceived my father,
do not hope that you will deceive me too.... You
want all the Chinese to become Christians; your
religion requires it, I know, but what would become
of us then? In times of trouble the people would
listen to no voice but yours." This naÃ¯ve and
unanimous testimony to the potency of the
Christian faith must have been rather cheering
than depressing to those to whom it was addressed,
and that they did not fail to perceive that their
Imperial enemy was no ordinary man is proved by
the eulogy pronounced on him by Father Du
Halde, who says: "It is impossible to help
admiring his indefatigable application to work;
day and night his thoughts are occupied on the
establishment of a wise government which will
secure the well-being of his subjects; to please him,
you have but to propose some project of public
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
utility.... He has made several very good regulations
with a view to doing honour to merit,
and recompensing virtue, for promoting emulation
amongst the labouring classes, and to help the
people in barren years. These qualities have won
for him in a very short time the respect and love
of all his subjects."</p>

<p>These quotations throw a luminous side-light
upon the character of the Emperor, and make it
the more evident how short-sighted was the conduct
which led to the breach between his father and the
Jesuits. Had the latter continued the policy with
which their predecessors had begun, conciliating
public opinion by the study of the arts and sciences
to which Government and people were alike devoted,
instead of splitting straws about doctrine and
phraseology, the sad stories of the massacres of
defenceless women and children would never have
had to be written. It was one of the Jesuit Fathers
who gave Kang-Hi his first clock, and another
who won the hearts of all the ladies of the court
by making a camera-obscura, which enabled them
to see something of the outside world from which
they were so rigorously excluded. With the expulsion
of the Jesuits in the eighteenth century
all the work done by them was destroyed, and the
missionaries who succeeded them had to contend
with the prejudices their short-sighted policy had
aroused, as well as with the difficulties inseparable
from every attempt to introduce a new religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">CONCESSIONS TO FOREIGNERS</div>

<p>In every port thrown open of recent years to
European commerce the Imperial Government sets
aside what are called concessions to the foreign
residents, whom the authorities still look upon as
unwelcome intruders, though the citizens are not
slow to appreciate the difference between their
own unsavoury and crowded quarters, and the
well-built, airy streets occupied by the English,
the French, or the Germans. In these concessions
missionaries of pretty well every sect have, of
course, hastened to obtain a footing, and volumes
might be filled with the record of their struggles,
their difficulties, their triumphs, and their defeats.
It will be enough for our present purpose to tell
of the massacre, referred to above, of the French
Sisters at Tien-tsin, for it was alike one of the most
horrible and most typical of modern times. By
the treaty signed therein 1858 the port was thrown
open to foreign trade, and in 1861 a British consulate
was established in it. The memory of the
sack of Pekin by the Anglo-French forces was
still fresh, and the hatred of the foreign devils was
fiercer and if possible more bitter in Tien-tsin
than elsewhere, for so far its people had had very
little intercourse with Europeans. Only amongst
the more enlightened of the Chinese was the fact
recognized that the time for opposition to the entry
of foreigners was gone by, and that if the country
were not opened from within, it would be forced
from without, and the dismemberment of the
Empire become inevitable.</p>

<p>Situated on the right bank of the Pei-ho, Tien-tsin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
is the port of the capital, from which it is
eighty miles distant. It is therefore one of the keys
of China, and even before the opening of the railway
from it to Pekin in 1897, it was of immense
strategic importance. All this of course intensified
the jealousy of the Chinese, when the lock was forced,
so to speak, by the white skins, and great indeed
was the courage needed to face the turbulent population,
and endeavour to win proselytes from amongst
them. Even in Shanghai, comparatively inured to
the presence of the foreign element, nuns had been
insulted; a native spitting in the faces of two holy
women in the streets, who had done absolutely
nothing to provoke hostility.</p>

<p>Yet there were found devoted women who came
to reside in Tien-tsin, carrying their lives in their
hands, knowing full well what they had to expect,
yet determined to face unflinchingly not only the
hostility of the natives, but also the rigours of the
inhospitable climate, for the river is blocked with
ice from December to May, and before the opening
of the railway there could be no hope of help from
without in the winter, no matter what the emergency.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">FIG. 45.&mdash;A TEMPLE AT TSIN.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE PURCHASE OF GIRLS</div>

<p>The Sisters, however, set to work directly they
arrived, aided by the French AbbÃ© Chevrier, M.
Fontanier, the French Consul, and his assistant,
M. Simon. They quickly organized their plan of
campaign; some opening a hospital where all
sufferers were received, no matter of what nationality
or religion, whilst others devoted themselves
to the education of the little girls bought by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
AbbÃ© with the fund known in France as that of
the <i>Sainte-Enfance</i> or Holy Infancy. In the school
kept by the devoted ladies, the Chinese maidens
were lodged, fed, and taught to do different kinds
of needlework, as well as educated in the Roman
Catholic religion. It was the purchase of the
pupils that was really at the root of the terrible
troubles which overtook the Mission. The Celestials,
as has already been explained above, are in
the habit of buying girls, but for a very different
purpose to that of the devoted priests and Sisters.
They too have hospitals for the indigent and
infirm, but they could not be brought to believe
that the missionaries received the children merely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
to feed, educate, and make Christians of them.
The rumour quickly spread, not only in Tien-tsin,
but in Shanghai and elsewhere, that good money
was to be got by selling children to the Sisters, and
certain natives at once set to work to kidnap little
ones with a view to securing what they thought
would be a lucrative trade. So many girls were
stolen, and the missionaries lent so much colour to
the accusation against them of connivance by the
increasing number of their <i>protegÃ©es</i> that public
feeling was thoroughly aroused. The cry of
"Stealers of children" was raised, and foreigners,
especially the French, had stones thrown at them
in the streets.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that if the missionaries had
been wise, they would have given up receiving
children for a time, whether in the orphanage or
the hospital, but religious zeal was not in this case
tempered with discretion, and terrible indeed were
the results of this short-sighted policy. Of course
all the girls rescued by the nuns were not bought,
but a great many of them were, for the Chinese
law encourages the selling of female children.
Moreover, if calumnies were circulated about
foreigners, they in their turn did not hesitate to
spread reports of the unnatural way in which
Chinese mothers treated their children, and much
was written on the subject in the reports sent
home. I, however, can testify from personal inquiry
that these were quite unfounded libels. In Canton
every one I questioned on the subject repudiated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the accusations with the greatest indignation.
There was, however, the question to which I never
could get a satisfactory reply, and that was, "Is it
true that the Chinese cause the death of deformed
children at their birth?" Evasive answers were
always made to this downright inquiry, but with
regard to healthy, well-formed infants of either
sex, I will quote verbatim what a wealthy Chinese
merchant of very influential position said to me:</p>

<div class="sidenote">A FALSE ACCUSATION</div>

<p>"It is unfortunately true," he said, "that children
have sometimes been abandoned by Chinese
mothers, but only under very sad circumstances,
generally the failure of the harvest. Do you know
what has led to some of your priests accusing the
Chinese of being unnatural parents, mere brutes
resembling cats and dogs? It is because now and
then our teeming population of four hundred
million souls is visited by terrible and extraordinary
misfortunes, such as a sudden outbreak
of the cholera or the plague, which are, however,
among the least of our troubles, for even more
frequent, more destructive to life, is the famine
which occurs every year, now in the north, now in
the south, now in the east, now in the west. If the
rice-crop fail through a dry season, thirty or fifty
millions of human creatures are in danger of
perishing from hunger if sufficient relief does not
reach them in time. We have not the means you
in Europe have of speedy communication between
our provinces; we have no railways, no fleets of
steamers to take grain from one place to another.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Well, what happens? Just what occurs when
some town or island is blockaded in war. Old
men and children perish first, and if a few of the
infants do survive, what can the mothers do but
thrust them away from them when the milk in
their breasts is all dried up? Under these circumstances
you may see able-bodied men eating such
things as rats, snakes, and vermin, which the
Chinese are accused of devouring with delight
even in times of plenty. I know nothing about
the history of your country, but you ought to
know it well. Will you swear to me that there has
never been a time when women have been driven
to let their children die for want of nourishment
and warmth? You do not answer. So it is
evident that terrible things such as this have
happened in Europe. Well now, would it not be
downright unfair of me, if knowing this to be
truth, I turned your silence against you by preaching
throughout China that French mothers, like
those in China, fling their children into the gutter?"</p>

<p>Was not this a sensible speech?&mdash;and would it
not be well if missionaries were equally wise in
their way of looking at things? Is it not a pity
that so many enthusiastic young men and women
should be sent to meet a terrible death in a vain
effort to alter what cannot be changed? Those
who sanction the going forth of these bands of
devoted martyrs do not make sufficient allowance
for the fact that the indifference of the Chinese to
Christianity is really a part of their own religion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
They cultivate stoicism, they never allow anything
to upset their <i>sangfroid</i>, but meet torture and
death with equal composure. It is a hopeless task
to endeavour to rouse them to enthusiasm about
anything. It would be wiser to leave their conversion
alone. All this does not, however, detract
in any way from the heroism of the Sisters at
Tien-tsin, who, in spite of the ever-increasing
hostility to them, went on doing their charitable
work, unheeding the danger in which they must
have known they stood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHUNG-HO</div>

<p>It was on June 22, 1870, that fatal year for
France, just before the breaking out of the Franco-German
War, when the relations between the
French Government and that of Pekin were considerably
strained, that the long-smouldering fire
broke into flame in Tien-tsin. The Governor,
Chung-Ho by name, a Tartar by birth, a kindly man
enough, but far too weak for the position he held,
was really responsible for the massacre, though he
endeavoured to shelter himself from responsibility
behind the mandarins, whom he ought to have
controlled. The rising against the foreigners had
evidently been preconcerted, for there was really
no apparent cause for the sudden rush of the
bravos upon their victims. It has been said that
the French Consul, M. Fontanier, who was the first
to fall beneath the blows of the assassins, really
gave the signal for the massacre by presenting his
revolver at the head of the Governor, but this of
course was only an excuse, and nothing could
really have averted the catastrophe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>From nine in the morning to five in the afternoon
of the terrible day the killing went on, the French
being hunted through the streets and struck down,
often on the very thresholds of their houses. After
the murder of the French consul, his interpreter,
M. Thomassin, and his young wife were attacked;
and in a futile attempt to save the latter Thomassin
was terribly wounded. He managed to fling himself
into the canal, which flows near the Consulate, but
the literati were determined that he should not
escape, and he was dispatched in the water. Meanwhile,
as a shepherd calls his flock together when
the wolves are threatening, the AbbÃ© Chevrier had
collected around him the orphan children to the
number of one hundred then under the care of the
missionaries; but they were all massacred, the good
priest dying amongst them. A French merchant
and his wife, with three Russians who were mistaken
for Frenchmen, were also murdered.</p>

<p>The Sisters in the orphanage and hospital were,
strange to say, the last to hear of the awful scenes
being enacted in the streets. Secure in their belief
that they had done no evil, and that, therefore, no one
could wish to harm them, they quietly went on with
their work, and did not even demand the protection
of the Chinese authorities. This would, however,
probably have been powerless to save them; for it
was the mandarins who had been most active in
circulating slanders against them, saying that they
used the eyes of children for making some of their
medicines, and spreading all manner of other silly
reports. The simple-minded Sisters had only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
laughed when told of these slanders, but they
would have been wiser to try and refute them, for
they were believed by the common people as
readily as stories about witches were in Europe
not so very long ago.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MURDER OF THE SISTERS</div>

<p>The sun was already setting, lighting up the
streets reddened with the blood of the innocent,
when the murderers, their rage increased by the
ease with which they had killed their victims,
seem suddenly to have remembered that there
were defenceless women at the orphanage still
to be destroyed, and with one accord they rushed
to the doors clamouring for admittance. Their
shouts being unheeded, they lost no time in breaking
down the door, and found the Superior of
the Sisterhood calmly waiting to receive them.
Alas! her fortitude availed her nothing; she was
brutally seized, dragged to a post not far off and
bound to it. Then ensued a scene too horrible for
description; the fiends in human shape danced
round their helpless victim, and inflicted on her
all the tortures in which the Chinese are so terribly
skilled, finally cutting her body into small pieces.
The terrified nuns kneeling on the steps of their
little chapel in agonized prayer were one and all
first outraged and then murdered, their home and
church were set fire to, and their mangled bodies
flung into the flames. One poor young girl had
had the sense to disguise herself as a Chinese, and
was hastening towards the English Consulate to
take refuge there, when unfortunately she was
recognized and murdered by some Chinese soldiers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Not one French man or woman escaped, and the
indignation throughout France when the terrible
news arrived can be imagined.</p>

<p>As usual, the Imperial Government was profuse
in apologies and excuses, for well did the Emperor
and his advisers know how terrible might be the
vengeance exacted by France for the blood of
her children. A few Chinese heads were cut off&mdash;in
China heads are of little account,&mdash;and it
was determined at Pekin that a very high official
should be sent to Paris to make due apology, and
promise that nothing of the kind should occur
again. It was of course difficult to decide who
should be entrusted with this delicate mission, and
the choice actually fell on Chung-Ho, the Governor
of Tien-tsin, the very man, as has been seen, to
whose culpable neglect the tragedy was due. But
for the fact that the unfortunate country of France
was then in the throes of her most awful experience
of modern times, the probability is that the blood-stained
Tartar would have met with a reception
in its capital very little to his taste. As things
were, however, no one in France suspected who
he really was, public attention was concentrated
on the war. The death of the French missionaries
in remote Tien-tsin was already forgotten in the
anguish of defeat, and the necessity for organizing
the defence against the ruthless invaders. The
Empire had fallen; the Emperor was a prisoner
in the hands of the Germans&mdash;safer there than he
would have been amongst his own disillusioned
subjects. The interview with M. Thiers was put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
off again and again, until at last a comparatively
leisure time was secured. Then, alas! that I should
have to write it, the Chinese traitor was presented
to the Chief of the State with all the ceremonial
due to foreign ambassadors. He was escorted to
the ElysÃ©e in a state-carriage by a guard of
cuirassiers, and received with all the usual honours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TWO PRIESTS BURNT ALIVE</div>

<p>No good result ensued for French interests in
China from this interview, and soon after the return
of the envoy to his native country, yet another
missionary, M. HuÃ©, was assassinated in the
province of Se-Tchuen; whilst not far from the
scene of the murder of Margary, related in a
previous chapter, two priests were burnt alive, and
four of their proselytes cut to pieces.</p>

<p>But enough of these horrors, I must dwell on
them no more, for I have no wish to intensify race
hatred, or to raise French feeling against a nation
with which we have a treaty of peace. I must,
however, add just one word to show how indomitable
is the missionary spirit in the religious orders
of France. In 1876, when the country was beginning
to settle down after the awful events of the
preceding years, that is to say, six years after the
massacre at Tien-tsin, another party of Sisters
went to that very town to begin again the work of
charity so tragically interrupted, although it was
well known that there was no abatement in the
bitterness of the feeling against foreigners, and
that the mandarins were especially averse to
female missionaries. The unselfish devotion, seeking
for no earthly reward, of the saintly nuns is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
well illustrated by the reply made to me when I
went to the head-quarters of the Sisterhood in the
<i>Rue de Bac</i>, Paris, and asked the Lady Superior
to give me the names of the martyrs of 1870 that
I might render to them the honour so justly due.
Those names were refused, "for," said the austere
head of the order, "our nuns have won the greatest
of all rewards already, and that is enough."</p>

<p>The new-comers to the site watered by the blood
of the innocent, have proceeded exactly on the same
lines as their predecessors; they opened a hospital
and some schools, apparently in total ignorance of
the dangers surrounding them. A tri-colour flag
floats once more from the buildings under their
control. The "Cyclamens," as lovers of flowers call
the caps worn by the devoted Sisters, are once more
familiar objects in the streets of Tien-tsin. May
their labour of love be rewarded as it deserves, and
may God temper the wind to them as He does to
the lambs shorn of their fleece, for truly they sorely
need the protection of Heaven in their defenceless
condition! Fortunately, however, they are no longer
so isolated as were the pioneers of missionary
effort in 1870. In 1881 the port of Tien-tsin became
connected by telegraph with Shanghai, where
there is a large foreign population, and the Chinese
have of late years had so many proofs that
foreigners are not to be massacred or in any way
injured with impunity, that there is some hope of
the avoidance for the future of such tragedies as that
we have recorded here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a relief to turn from the terrible events
which have given to Tien-tsin such a sinister
notoriety to visit from it the celebrated Great
Wall of China, the western termination of which is
at no great distance from the town on the north.
Begun by the Emperor Shih-Hwang-Ti, in <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 214,
as a protection against the invasions of the Tartars,
it was completed in the marvellously short time of
five years, that energetic monarch sparing neither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
expense nor trouble, and ruthlessly sacrificing the
lives of thousands of his subjects in his determination
to keep out the hated barbarians. That he
was not successful, but that his rampart in due
time served his enemies better than it had done
himself, is one of those ironies of fate with which the
student of history is familiar. Tartars, Mongols,
and Manchus have in their turn reigned over
China from the sacred city, within the very defences
supposed to be impregnable; the mighty wall
remaining a standing proof, not of the wisdom, but
of the short-sightedness of its builder.</p>

(<i>Univers Pittoresque.</i>)</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE GREAT WALL</div>

<p>To secure a sufficient number of men to work at
his wall, Shih-Hwang-Ti issued an edict ordering
every third labourer throughout the whole of the
Empire to labour at it, and the unfortunate men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
thus selected were forced to work like slaves, with no
wages but a scanty supply of food, their places when
they fell down dead being quickly taken by other
victims. The wall, when completed at the cost of
so great an expenditure of human life, was fifteen
hundred miles long; its breadth at the bottom was
nearly twenty-five feet, and at the top fifteen feet,
whilst it varied in height from fifteen to thirty feet.
The materials employed would, it is said, be enough
to build a wall six feet high and two feet thick to
go twice round the world. Six horsemen could ride
abreast upon it, and it was fortified by very strong
towers, placed at regular intervals of about one
hundred yards, that is to say, within two arrow-shots
of each other, so that any one attempting
to scale it would be covered from one tower or
another by the guards stationed in them. The
construction of the wall was very strong, the outside
being formed of stone and brickwork, whilst
the inside was filled up with earth. The wall
started from the sea-shore at the Shan-Hai Pass, in
N. Lat. 40Â° and E. Long. 119Â° 50&#8242;, and ran over
mountains, through valleys, and across rivers by
means of arches, which are still marvels of engineering
skill, to the most western province of Kan-su,
where it ends at the Khiya Pass. Whilst only
insignificant relics now remain of the immense
Roman walls which once intersected England and
France, this vast monument of an ambitious ruler
still stands, ranking as one of the wonders of the
world, an incidental proof that at the time of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
its erection, two thousand years ago, China must
have already been a great and civilized Empire.
There is no doubt that Shih-Hwang-Ti did succeed
in centralizing authority, and absorbing the power
of the numerous military chiefs who before his time
reigned in the various small kingdoms, making up
what is now the Celestial Empire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BURNING OF MSS.</div>

<p>Unfortunately, however, the monarch aimed rather at his own
aggrandizement than at the good of his people, and
his vainglorious desire to be looked upon as the
founder of the Chinese monarchy led him to issue
that celebrated edict, ordering all books and writings
referring to his predecessors to be burnt,
which inflicted an incalculable loss on future
students of history. Those who endeavoured to
evade this sweeping decree were to be punished by
death, and according to some accounts, hundreds of
literati were burnt on piles of the MSS. they had
tried to save. In spite of all precautions, however,
some few copies of the works of Confucius and
other great writers were successfully hidden and
brought out again on the death of the tyrant.</p>

<p>On this interesting subject Father Gaubil, in his
valuable work on Chinese Chronology, says: "One
thing is certain ... the books containing the
geographical surveys and the departmental records
were not burnt ... though the minister Lis-sse,
like the Emperor himself, wished the people to
remain ignorant, and know nothing about how the
country was governed by the earlier kings, or to
hear of the great and virtuous men of the past, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
of the precepts left behind by them." It was this
same minister, the Father tells us, who introduced
the salutary reform of the use of one character only
throughout the Empire, whereas before his time
several different kinds of letters were employed in
writing. This alphabet was known as the <i>li-chu</i>,
and is supposed to be identical with that of the
present day.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>It was indeed fortunate that so many important
manuscripts were saved from the general holocaust
the sacrilegious Emperor had ordered, for had
the <i>Shu-King</i> been destroyed, it would have been
difficult to give any real account of the China of
the past. This most celebrated and authentic of
ancient books is supposed to have been begun about
the year 2266 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, in the reign of the great Yao,
brother of that King Ti-Ko, who introduced the
polygamy still practised in China. This book, or
rather collection of books, is to the Celestials what
the Bible is to the Jews, the Koran to the Mahomedans,
the Law-Book of Manu to the Hindus,
and the Gospel to Christians. It is the very fountain-head
of Chinese law, and not to be acquainted
with its contents is to be unworthy of holding any
place of trust in the Empire. Its authenticity is
absolutely established, for it is well known that
ever since the year 2637 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> there has been a
historic Tribunal in Pekin, whose members are
chosen from amongst the most distinguished literati
of the whole Empire. Once appointed, these
scholars can never be removed from office, and it is
their duty to register daily everything of importance
that occurs in any town, including meteorological
and other natural phenomena, as well as
what may be called purely historical events, such
as the revolts, sieges, fires, and other misfortunes
to which humanity is subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SHU-KING</div>

<p>Father Amiot, a very cultivated and intelligent
French missionary, says on the subject of the sacred
books of the <i>Shu-King</i>: "The Chinese annals are
superior to the historical documents of every other
nation, because there is less fabulous matter in
them, and because they are more ancient ... and
more full of information of every kind ... They
are worthy of our fullest confidence, because the
epochs to which they refer are determined by
astronomical observations, and the accounts of the
events of all kinds which occur in those epochs
can be mutually checked, and are found, when
compared, to prove the good faith of the writers
who have transmitted them to us."</p>

<p>They are indeed simply invaluable to the student,
forming as they do absolutely trustworthy guides
to their researches into the early history of China,
carrying it back for long centuries, or rather
sexagenaries, for, as already remarked, the Chinese
chronology reckons by sixties, not hundreds of
years. One incidental proof of their veracity is
the fact that their writers, when not fully informed,
have left gaps in their narratives instead of filling
them up as so many chroniclers would have done
with imaginary matter.</p>

<p>They are moreover works of literature rather
than mere dry historical documents, and there is
no series of books in the whole world on which so
many able men have been employed as on the
sacred records of the Chinese nation.</p>

<p>What tales the literati might have told in those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
old days of their adventures on their way to the
capital to take up their work as chroniclers! Even
when I made the journey from Tien-tsin to Pekin,
before the opening of the railway, I had variety
enough, travelling now by boat, now in a palanquin,
now in a sedan-chair, and sometimes on horseback,
and things must have been far worse in those early
days of the beginning of history. One shudders
to think of what our own diplomatic agents must
have gone through when, after much difficulty, they
did at last obtain the coveted honour of representing
the Western powers in the chief city of the
Celestial Empire. They must have suffered horribly,
the more that their presence was thoroughly
unwelcome, and it was the delight of every petty
official to throw obstacles in their way. The old
literati, on the other hand, were treated with the
greatest respect, and except when they happened
to make some mistake in their astronomical calculations,
when their heads paid the forfeit, they lived
in considerable luxury.</p>

<p>Pekin, though still not exactly the place
Europeans would choose to live in, is now comparatively
civilized, and in the spacious rooms of
the European ambassadors the foreign residents
dine, sup, and dance very much as they would in
the capitals of their own countries. Thanks to
the seclusion of the sedan-chairs, even ladies can
go about without attracting notice, or having to
pick their way through the ill-smelling rubbish
which still encumbers the streets. No traveller
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
in China with the slightest self-respect goes on
foot, and any foreigner who attempts walking lays
himself open to every insult. "A chair," says a
writer who knows China well, "is far more effective
than a passport," and the ambassadors and ambassadresses,
the secretaries of legation, the consuls
and their wives, employ large numbers of coolies
to carry them to and fro. There is something
truly wonderful in the way in which a mere
handful of Europeans live their own lives, following
their own customs, in the midst of a population
of three hundred thousand Tartars, Mongols, and
Manchus, not to speak of the four hundred thousand
Chinese citizens, and the hundred thousand soldiers
forming the garrison.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PEKIN MARKETS</div>

<p>Pekin now actually boasts of two bakers who
make bread of fine American flour, and are largely
patronized by the foreign residents; and in the
markets, the native cooks who cater for the
Embassies, find plenty of variety for the tables of
their employers at a very reasonable price, including
two kinds of pheasant, the grey and the red-legged
partridge. Wild geese and wild duck, the
hare, the boar, the antelope and the roebuck are
also all plentiful, and mutton can be had as tender
as that of Wales, Normandy, or the Ardennes.</p>

<p>Not so very long ago, visitors to Pekin had to
go to wretched inns where they were far from
welcome, or to ask hospitality from the foreign
residents, but now there are two hotels where
travellers are as well treated as in the West. One,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
called the HÃ´tel FranÃ§ais, is kept by a jovial
Chinaman, who was at one time cook to an English
diplomatist; the other, called the German Hotel,
is managed by a burly native of Frankfort, who
reminds me of nothing so much as of a Heidelberg
tun. In these two inns the rooms are big, with
wide chimneys and good windows, so that really it
is possible to be quite comfortable in them, even
in winter, if one can avoid the streets, with their
deep mud or dust, as the case may be.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">FIG. 48.&mdash;A STREET IN PEKIN.</div>
</div>

<p>It is to Pekin that thousands of students who
have already won the second degree of rank, as
literati, flock to compete for the distinction known
as the Tsen-Sze, which corresponds to some extent
with that of a doctor of law in England. The
scholar who comes out first in the examinations is
considered for the current year the most learned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
man in all the eighteen provinces of China, and is
privileged to choose a post in the very highest
department of the Government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHINESE EXAMINATIONS</div>

<p>Out of the nine or ten hundred candidates who
are examined by the doctors of the Han-Lin College,
three hundred are selected, and again tested in the
presence of the Emperor. Then ten of these three
hundred are picked out to compete once more for
the coveted first grade, to win which is the
ambition of every literary man in China, for it is
equally open to all, though achieved by but few.
The ten who are considered worthy are subjected
to a very severe final test by a jury selected by the
Emperor himself. Their replies to the examination
questions are written out, richly bound, and placed
before the so-called Son of Heaven, who reads all
the manuscripts, and points out the three he
considers the best. The authors of these three are
raised to first rank, and are <i>fÃ©ted</i> throughout the
capital for three days, marching round it, accompanied
by processions bearing flags, beating drums,
etc. Of the rest of the three hundred, some become
professors at the Han-Lin College, whilst others
receive appointments in various parts of the
country.</p>

<p>The hall in which the examinations take place
has attached to it a number of very small cells, not
more than six feet long by three wide and five
high&mdash;an incidental proof of the average stature
of the Chinese&mdash;in one of which each candidate is
shut up alone, so that the judges maybe quite sure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
his work is all his own. The aspirant to literary
honour is even searched to see that he has no
books or papers hidden in his robes. He is then
supplied with writing materials, and his replies to
the questions put to him are not signed, so there
is no fear of partiality on the part of the judges.
The only furniture of the examination cell is a
plank placed across it
about fifteen inches
above the ground to
serve as a seat, and a
little tablet fixed to the
wall to be used as a
desk. There is sometimes
such a run upon
the cells that a student
has to wait for days
before he can secure
one. Amongst the cells
named after the "Red
Dragon," the little room
is still shown in which
the fourth Emperor of the present dynasty worked
at certain of the usual examination papers with a
view to shedding lustre on the literary life. He had
the courage and perseverance to remain shut up in
complete seclusion for nine days; but he evidently
found the task he had set himself very arduous,
for, since his experiment, students have been allowed

</div>

<div class="sidenote">KUBLAI KHAN</div>

<p>The two most interesting facts connected with
the history of Pekin are that it is one of the most
ancient cities of the world, occupying the site of
the capital of the old province of Yen, which is
known to have been in existence 1200 years before
the Christian era, and that it was made the seat
of government by Kublai Khan, the first Mongol
Emperor of China, grandson of the mighty conqueror
Genghis Khan. This Kublai Khan, though
a conqueror and of foreign race, so won the affections
of the Chinese that he was justly called the
Father of his people, and during his reign the
country enjoyed a prosperity never since equalled.
The native rulers who had preceded the Mongols
had been mere phantom sovereigns, the puppets
of their eunuchs and the women of their harems,
altogether oblivious of the great example set them
by the early monarchs of China.</p>

<p>The warlike and highly civilized Mongols had
long since conquered all the districts north and
west of the great wall of China, and for years had
cast longing eyes at the fertile regions on the other
side of that artificial barrier, and when Kublai
Khan came to the throne, a mere child; the last
survivor of the Soong line was Emperor of China.
In this fact the Mongol ruler saw his opportunity,
and is said to have sent the following message to
the young prince: "Your family owes its rise to
the minority of the last Emperor of the preceding
dynasty, it is therefore just that you, a child, the
last remnant of the line of Soong, should give place
to another family."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether this Mongol expression of the time-honoured
doctrine that might makes right ever
reached the ears of the infant prince or not, the
approach of the great Khan warriors so terrified
the Court, that the Emperor and the ministers took
refuge with him on the vessels in the harbour of
Canton. There they were followed by the Tartar
war-ships, and the terror they inspired was such
that the fugitives all flung themselves into the
sea, one of the chief grandees being the first to
jump overboard with the young Emperor in his
arms. More than one hundred soldiers and sailors
are supposed to have perished on this fatal day,
either from poison, by drowning, or at the hands
of the enemy.</p>

<p>This terrible event took place in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1280 or
1281, when Kublai Khan became sovereign of the
whole of China, and fixed his capital at what is
now Pekin, but was then called Khan-balegh,
or the capital of the Khan. He surrounded his
palace with a wall six leagues in circumference,
pierced by twelve gateways; the roofs of his
residence were very lofty and spacious, richly
decorated with gold and silver, and with paintings
representing birds, horses, dragons, and other
quaint symbolic animals. The roof of the palace
was gilded, and six thousand warriors could take
shelter in it at one time.</p>

<p>Kublai Khan, who was as wise in statecraft as
in battle, took care not to interfere with the institutions
of his new subjects; all the officials who
submitted to him were allowed to retain their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
posts, and the Chinese themselves were exempted
from military service. This of course concentrated
all the power in the hands of the Mongols, and did
more than anything else could have done to consolidate
the new dynasty, though the Celestials
themselves do not seem to have realized its full
significance. The new Emperor was visited at his
Court of Khan-balegh, or Cambalu, by Marco Polo,
that most venturesome traveller and astute observer,
whose account of his sojourn with the great
Mongol conqueror gives so vivid a picture of life
in China in the thirteenth century. Hospitably
received by the Khan, the Venetian dwelt much
in his book on the magnificence of his court, and
makes the sage and humorous remark: "Kublai,
who was the first to invent paper-money made
from the inner bark of the mulberry-tree, had
discovered the true philosopher's stone, for he could
create wealth at his own desire."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GREAT CANAL</div>

<p>A far greater boon than the introduction of paper
currency was the making of the great canal, which
rivals the celebrated wall in the skill of its construction,
and has been of far more lasting value
to the people of China than that monument of the
energy and presumption of Shih-Hwang-Ti. One
hundred and seventy thousand men were employed
in this useful enterprise, which was not completed
until after the death of its promoter. The wonderful
waterway, before it fell into disrepair, extended
from the capital to Hang-Chan in the province
of Che-kiang, and was more than three hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
miles long. Marco Polo said of it: "He (Kublai
Khan) has caused a water communication to be
made in the shape of a wide and deep channel
dug between stream and stream, between lake and
lake, forming as
it were a great
river on which
large vessels can ply."</p>

<div class="sidenote">SAYINGS OF KUBLAI KHAN</div>

<p>Various sayings of the wise
thinker and practical
worker, at
the head of the
newly conquered
country, have
come down to
us. Amongst these may be
quoted as specially significant,
the address made
by the Emperor to three great philosophers whom
he had summoned to his presence to aid him in
the difficult task of government, in preventing the
exodus of the inhabitants from the towns, and the
desertion of the country by the cultivators. "You
must help me," he said, "to make your fellow-countrymen
listen to reason; they look upon us
now as if we were bears or tigers; they are afraid
of us when we only wish to do them good. My
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
one desire is to make them happy under my rule,
and they will believe it if you tell them so. You,
Yao-Theu," he added, "I make general inspector
of the agricultural districts; travel about in them,
and manage to get them restored to their former
owners and cultivated as before; I give you full
authority to bring this about."</p>

<p>"As for you, Hin-Heng and Teo-mo, I place the
people under your protection; watch over the
health and tranquillity of the artisans and workmen,
so that they labour as of yore, and that they look
forward to enjoying the fruits of their industry in
peace. Moreover, I give you full powers to re-open
schools wherever they used to be, or to build new
ones if you think it desirable; in a word, do all
that you think will promote the good of the public&mdash;I
approve in advance of everything you may
decide on."</p>

<p>Long before the time of Richelieu, Kublai Khan
formed an academy, to which flocked scholars and
men of letters of every nationality. From India,
from Persia, and from beyond the Oxus they came,
as well as from the different countries of Europe,
attracted by the fame of the learning in the
Chinese capital. Marco Polo, who for three years
was governor of one of the southern provinces of
China, became a member of this academy, and
Hin-Heng, one of the philosophers alluded to
above, also belonged to it, excelling all his <i>confrères</i>
in the variety of his acquirements. Speaking of
him. Father Amiot says: "There was no science he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
had not studied, and he succeeded in them all ...
he gave his attention to chronology, to history, and
to music. He was a geometrician and astronomer,
and he was one of the savants who worked at the
reform of the Chinese almanac ... he was well
versed in the ancient history of his nation, he
knew the laws and
customs of his native
land, and explained
them so clearly that
Kublai Khan entrusted to him the
drawing up of the
code for his dynasty.
To all this knowledge
he added that of the
Mongol language, in
which he composed
several excellent
works, not to speak
of the translations he
made of the best
Chinese books....
He also made commentaries on the <i>Shu-King</i>, or
sacred books."</p>

</div>

<p>Very vivid is the light thrown by these quotations
on the civilization of the capital of China
under the Mongol ruler, and, thanks once more to
Marco Polo, we are able to form a very accurate
idea of the personal appearance of Kublai Khan.
"The great Lord of lords," the celebrated traveller
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
tells us, "is of a good stature, neither little nor
big, but of medium height ... his limbs are well
formed ... his face is white, with cheeks like a
rose; his nose is well shaped and prominent." The
chronicler further tells us that Kublai Khan had
four wives, whom he treated exactly alike, and
that his eldest, no matter by which mother, would
succeed him when he died. According to other
authorities, one wife alone enjoyed the title of
Empress, and she had three hundred female slaves
to attend upon her.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A DEGENERATE EMPEROR</div>

<p>The founder alike of the Mongol, or, as it is
sometimes called, the Yuan dynasty, and of Pekin,
lived to the advanced age of eighty-three, and was
succeeded by his grandson Timur; but able as
that prince was, he was by no means equal to his
predecessor. Later members of the Tartar race,
who occupied the Chinese throne, did not follow
the example of the old Manchu rulers, so that the
wonderfully-organized government of Kublai Khan
gradually fell to pieces, and at the end of seventy-three
years yet another new dynasty supplanted
that which had appeared so firmly established. No
one can wonder at this who reads the stories told
of Shun-Ti, the ninth and last Mongol sovereign,
who, called to the supreme power at the early age
of thirteen, amused himself by watching the dancing
of sixteen young girls, called the sixteen
spirits, and wasted time and treasure in endeavouring
to pry into the future, with the aid of
soothsayers, whilst he neglected every duty he
owed to God and to his subjects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>Marco Polo left a glowing description of the
Imperial Palace at Kambala, or Pekin, where, he
tells us, "twice five miles of fertile ground, with
walls and towers, were girdled round," and as late
as 1793, when Lord Macartney visited the city, he
found that it was still very much what it had been
in the thirteenth century. On the change of
dynasty, after the expulsion of Shun-Ti, the capital
was transferred to Nanking, but in 1421 Pekin
was restored to its old dignity, and its walls were
still further extended. In the following centuries
its fortunes fluctuated greatly, and it was not until
1860, when it was taken by the Anglo-French
forces, that it began to assume anything of its
present appearance. The central or inner city,
known as the Manchu, is divided into three parts:
the Purple Forbidden Town containing the imperial
residences; the Imperial or August City, with the
great temples, where the imperial family worship
their ancestors; and the general city, beyond which
again is the so-called Chinese town, consisting of
a net-work of lanes and alleys, with two wide
thoroughfares intersecting each other at right
angles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A REPRESENTATIVE CAPITAL</div>

<p>The foreign legations are all grouped together
in the south-eastern corner of the August City,
and consist of Chinese palaces transformed into a
semblance of European houses. The French Legation
is the largest, though perhaps not the most
comfortable, and is situated in the centre of a very
fine park. After describing the imperial palaces,
the temples and pagodas of Pekin, and remarking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
on the great uniformity of their style of architecture,
a modern writer, who knows the city well,
says: "The chief ornaments of the streets are the
fronts of the shops; large panels of carved wood,
sometimes gilded, frame the faÃ§ades, the carvings
representing dragons, ph&#339;nixes, etc., the effect
being very decorative ... on the other hand, the
private houses, with their lofty walls and numerous
entrance courts, do nothing to contribute to the
beauty of the street." The modern Chinese are
ardent lovers of their homes, and the humblest
artisan lives alone, with his family, in the strictest
seclusion. "There is nothing," adds this true
observer, "to distinguish any one house from
another, and it is the same with the theatres and
opium dens; uniformity is the guiding principle in
everything, and even the priests of the various
missions have adopted the Chinese customs and
mode of plaiting the hair." The town of Pekin is,
in fact, unique in the power it seems to have of
making all who reside in it conform to one style.
It perfectly represents the country of which it is
the capital, with its intense hostility to innovation,
holding itself aloof from every other nation, ignoring
the very existence of the West for more than
twenty-five centuries, and only waking up to its
existence to despise it as the home of outer barbarians.
But of late years there has been change
in the very air even of Pekin; the opening of the
railway from it to Tien-tsin, two years ago, was
indeed a significant sign of the times, and the next
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
decade will doubtless witness the breaking down
of convention even in that stronghold of conservatism,
the Purple Forbidden City. Already
Tartar carts, Chinese chaises, blue and green sedan-chairs,
strings of camels, condemned prisoners
wearing the fatal cangue, Buddhist priests chanting
litanies, and even eunuchs of the Emperor himself,
in their black and yellow uniforms, are jostled by
riders on horseback or by carriages, but little
different from those in use in Paris and London.
The West has introduced the thin edge of the
wedge of its civilization into the inner citadel,
the time-honoured watchword of "China for the
Chinese" has lost its conjuring power, and the
attempt of the Empress Dowager to revive it can
but end in disaster for her and those she rules in
such an arbitrary and old-fashioned style.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> fall of the Mongol dynasty and final
banishment of the last Emperor of that once
famous race was brought about by a young Chinese
bonze named Choo, the son of a labourer, who joined
the rebels when they rose against the foreign ruler.
A delicate boy unfit for out-door toil, he had been
placed by his father in a monastery to be educated,
but he early became tired of the inactive life, and
enlisted in the Imperial army as a common soldier.
He soon distinguished himself, and rapidly rose to
a position of high rank, when he married a widow
with a fortune, belonging to a family disaffected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
towards the Government. Soon after the wedding
an insurrection broke out at Nanking, and thanks
to the influence of his bride the young Choo was
chosen leader. So great was his popularity that
thousands flocked to his standard, and after winning
several victories he led an army against
Pekin itself. The capital was taken, Shan-Ti
and his family driven into exile, and with one
accord the people proclaimed their beloved General
Choo Emperor. This was in 1366, and the Ming
dynasty founded by the labourer's son continued
to rule over China for three hundred years, when
it was superseded by that of the family to which
the present Emperor belongs.</p>

<p>On his accession to the throne Choo took the
name of Tae-tsoo, and chose Nanking for his
capital, converting Pekin into a principality, which
he gave to one of his sons, who, in his turn, when
he came to the throne on his father's death, once
more made it the chief city of the Empire. The
new monarch, Young-lo by name, who had a very
able adviser in his wife, inaugurated his reign by
restoring many national institutions for which
Kublai Khan had substituted those of the Mongols,
and Chinese chroniclers tell us he won all hearts
by his consideration and moderation. No longer
were the chief offices of State held by military
men; mandarins were restored to their former
rank, and many important privileges were granted
to the famous Han-lin College. Whereas Kublai
Khan and his successors had encouraged Buddhism,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
and neglected the teachings of Confucius, Tae-tsoo
revived the study of the works of the Chinese
sage, forbade women to become priestesses of the
Hindu religion, and men to enter convents until
they were forty years of age, a truly salutary
reform, saving many able natives from wasting
the best years of their lives in miserable inactivity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A CHILD EMPEROR'S DEATH</div>

<p>Speaking of Tae-tsoo, a Chinese historian says:
"Every man who knows how to turn circumstances
to account, to win a fortune and raise himself above
his fellows, must have some merit, but he who
from a state of absolute poverty succeeds in working
his way to the summit of human greatness,
taking his seat on the grandest throne in the
world, must indeed be of most extraordinary
superiority, worthy to represent Heaven itself as
ruler of the human race."</p>

<p>This richly-endowed being did not, however,
escape misfortune; before the thirty-one years of
his reign were over his favourite son died, and he
appointed his grandson, a child of thirteen, to
succeed him. The young prince was duly elected
to the supreme power; but his uncle, Young-lo,
coveted the throne, marched an army to Pekin,
and though repulsed at first, was finally successful
through the treachery of some soldiers who opened
the gates of the capital to him. The palace was
set fire to, and the child emperor perished in the
flames.</p>

<p>Young-lo was allowed to seat himself on the vacant
throne without much opposition; he removed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the capital to Pekin, and governed so well
that the crimes which had won him power were
forgotten. His reign was much disturbed by
invasions from the North, the restless Tartars
coveting the rich land from which they had been
driven out, and at the time it seemed likely that
the country would be conquered by them yet
again under their great chief Timur, or Tamerlane.
Most fortunately for the Celestials, he died on the
way to China at the head of his troops, and the
land was reprieved for a time at least.</p>

<p>It was during the reign of the usurper Young-lo
that a European vessel flying a European flag, that
of Portugal, entered a Chinese port. A Portuguese
ship had sailed up the Canton river in 1516, and
in 1520 a Portuguese Embassy had penetrated to
the very gates of Pekin; but its leader, Perez, was
sent back a prisoner to Canton, and never heard
of again by his fellow-countrymen. He is said,
however, to have been beheaded. It was not until
the middle of the century that the Portuguese
really obtained any footing in the country, but at
that time they did succeed in establishing themselves
at Macao.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXPULSION OF LI-KONG</div>

<p>The Ming dynasty was in its turn fated to be
overthrown by the restless and ambitious Tartars.
The last Emperor of Chinese birth, Whey-tsong,
ascended the throne in 1627, but the country was
so distracted by internecine feuds that he found
the task of government beyond his strength. He
committed suicide in his despair at hearing that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
one of the insurgent leaders had entered Pekin
at the head of a large body of soldiers. That
leader, Li-Kong by name, had himself proclaimed
Emperor, but was only acknowledged by certain
provinces, whilst a Chinese general, Woosankwei,
made peace with the Manchu Tartars in the name
of the nation, calling upon them to aid in deposing
the usurper.. They agreed, all too glad to get
an entry into the coveted land they had invaded
so often. Li-Kong was expelled, but the Tartar
chief, instead of appointing a Chinese monarch,
kept the supreme power himself He was hailed
as a deliverer when he entered Pekin, and ordered
a grand ceremonial to be observed at his own
investiture as Emperor. The Nemesis in store for
all traitors was, however, waiting for him; he was
taken ill immediately afterwards and died in great
agony. Strange to say, his son, Shun-Che, a child
of six years old, was allowed to succeed him, and
thus in 1644 was founded the dynasty known as
the Manchu Tartar, or Ch'ing, which has endured
to the present day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ORIGIN OF THE PIG-TAIL</div>

<p>The various provinces of the vast Celestial
Empire did not of course submit peacefully to
this usurpation, but Ama-van, the uncle of the
young monarch, who was appointed regent during
his minority, was a man of great ability, who
quelled every revolt as it arose. China still bears
the traces of the drastic measures employed to
restore peace to the distracted land, many a ruined
wall marking the site of a once populous town,
whilst other cities still standing are evidently but
half their original size. The guardian died when
his charge was only fourteen; still the young prince
had already learnt how to govern, and with a
wisdom beyond his years he managed to keep
the peace between his Tartar and Chinese subjects,
dividing honours and appointments equally
amongst members of the two races. It was during
the reign of this astute young sovereign that the
peculiar style of coiffure which is always looked
upon as distinctively Chinese, was first introduced,
and that as a sign of subjection to the Tartars.
Before the accession of Shun-Che the Celestials
had prided themselves on the luxuriance of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
dark masses of hair, and the issue of an edict
ordering all without distinction of age or rank to
have their heads shaved, but for one long tress
at the back to be plaited into a pig-tail, nearly
caused a fresh revolution. The penalty of noncompliance
was decapitation, and there were many
who chose that rather than the disgrace of submitting
to the hands of the barber. Still time,
the all-healer, has now reconciled the descendants
of the innovators to submit to what was originally
so detested a custom, and no Chinaman would
now feel happy without his pig-tail.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">FIG. 53.&mdash;CHINESE BRONZES. (<i>Univers Pittoresque.</i>)</div>
</div>

<p>Writing of the Chinese before the hated edict
was promulgated, Father Alvarez Semedo says:
"Men and women alike let their hair, generally
black, grow to a great length, which is why the
name of the 'kingdom of the people with black
hair' is sometimes given to China. The natives,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
adds this observer, "have little black eyes and
small noses; they think our big prominent noses
very ugly; the Chinese look upon them in fact
as a regular deformity. They grow very small
beards, and do not care for them to be thick, all
they are anxious about is that they should be
black, which is the most common colour; still they
do not object to red hair as the people of Thebes
used to do; they wear their hair long, and let it
grow just as nature makes it, never cutting it.
They give more attention to the arrangement of
their coiffure than any other nation of the world;
they would rather not have a single hair on their
chins than lose one from their polls."</p>

<p>Now the care expended on their luxuriant locks
by the ancestors of the modern Chinese is generally
concentrated on the once-hated pig-tail; but in
the case of old men with grand-children, on long
moustaches, and what is known as the pointed
Imperial beard. It is very evident that when the
Portuguese father quoted above was in China, the
Celestials had never seen the English, whom they
call the red devils, on account of the auburn hair
of so many of them. Had they done so the author
would never have said, "They do not object to red
hair!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have already, in telling the story of missionary
effort in China, referred to the various Emperors
of the reigning dynasty who occupied the throne
in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but a
few further details will be interesting, throwing as
they do a light upon the present state of politics
in China, where the Empire is tottering to its fall;
menaced by invaders, who, though they come
preaching peace, will eventually change the country
far more completely than did the fire and sword
of the Tartar hordes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>The founder of the Ch'ing dynasty died at the
early age of twenty-four, of grief, it is said, for the
death of a favourite wife, whom he had fallen in
love with during her husband's life, and taken to
his palace in defiance of every law, human and
divine. Certain historians relate, that to pick a
quarrel with the rightful spouse of the object of
his passion, he gave him a box on the ears which
caused him to die of shame. However that may
be, the Empress died a few days later; and Shun
Che was so distraught with grief that he would
have committed suicide but for the restraint put
upon him by the eunuchs of his court. According
to the revolting custom then still in vogue, he had
thirty men strangled on the tomb of the dead
Empress to attend her in the other world. He
then shaved his head and made pilgrimages from
one pagoda to another, bewailing his many sins,
especially that of having loved his lost one with
too great a love, and pleading for forgiveness.
This penance over, he went back to his palace at
Pekin. But, says the chronicler, a little time afterwards
he called for his Imperial mantle, and
having named his son, Kang-Hy, then only eight
years old, his successor, he wrapt himself in it
and expired with the words, "I go to join my
ancestors."</p>

<div class="sidenote">A JUST RULER</div>

<p>Once more a boy-emperor was raised to the
Imperial throne; but that boy was no ordinary
child, and grew up to be one of the greatest
monarchs who ever ruled the Celestial Empire.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
During his minority he was under the care of
four wise ministers, who, except for their cruelty
to the Christians, performed their difficult task
with skill and moderation. One of the very first
acts of the young monarch, when he took the reins
of government with his own hands, was to rescind
the measures against the Christians, placing their
religion on exactly the same standing as Buddhism,
and consulting the Jesuit fathers at every turn.
Many are the touching stories told of the way in
which Kang-Hy won all hearts, and some of them
read as if they had been culled from the Old
Testament. Take, for instance, the tale of the old
man, whom the Emperor in one of his royal
progresses found weeping by the wayside. Approaching
him, Kang-Hy asked the cause of his
grief: "My lord," was the reply, "my only son,
who was the joy of my life, has been taken from
me to serve the governor of the province, and
I have no one to comfort me in my old age, or
to mourn over my tomb." The Emperor went
straight to the Governor's palace, accompanied by
the complainant; and when the oppressor could
not deny the charge, Kang-Hy ordered him to be
beheaded. Then turning to the suppliant the
royal avenger thus addressed him: "To make
amends to you for the injury you have sustained,
I appoint you Governor in the room of him who
has proved himself so unworthy of that office."</p>

<p>Missionaries to China were in the habit of calling
Kang-Hy the Louis XIV. of China. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
contemporary of the <i>grand monarque</i> of France,
there was really something in his long and
brilliant reign not unlike that of the king who
acquired an ascendency over his subjects resembling
that of an Asiatic autocrat. He knew, as
Louis did, how to turn everything to account for
the glory of his kingdom, and before his death
in 1792 he had so consolidated his power, that
but for the weakness of his successors China might
still rank as a leader of the Orient. In his will,
a quotation from which is given below, he proves
alike his literary ability, his care for the best
interests of his people, and the exalted view he
took of his own duties:</p>

<div class="sidenote">PROCLAMATION OF KANG-HY</div>

<p>"I, the Emperor," he says, "who honour Heaven,
and am charged with the government of the country,
I issue this edict, and I assert that amongst the
Emperors who have governed the Universe there
has not been one who has looked upon the doing
reverence to Heaven and imitating his ancestors as
essential duties. The true manner to venerate
Heaven is to treat those who are far away with
goodness, and to advance those who are near
according to their merit. This is to procure for
the people rest and abundance; it is to identify
one's own well-being with that of the Universe;
it is to preserve the State from dangers before
those dangers occur, and to foresee with wisdom
the disorders which might occur.</p>

<p>"The princes who work on this plan from early
morning till evening, and are even thinking (of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
their subjects) during their sleep, who are ceaselessly
forming designs, the effects of which will
be enduring and of wide influence for the public
good, these princes, I say, are not far from the
accomplishment of their duties.</p>

<p>"I, Emperor, who am now seventy years old,
and have reigned for sixty of them, I owe
all my blessings to the invisible aid of Heaven
and earth, to that of my ancestors, and to that of
the God who presides over the Empire ... not to
my own feeble reason. According to history, more
than four thousand three hundred and fifty years
have elapsed since the reign of Hwang-Ti, and
during that great number of centuries there have
been three hundred and one Emperors, a few of
whom only have reigned as long as they might
have done.</p>

<p>"After my elevation to the throne, when I
reached the twentieth year of my reign, I did not
dare to count on seeing the thirtieth, and arrived
at the thirtieth, I did not dare look forward to
the fortieth, yet now find myself in the sixtieth.
Happiness is said to consist in five things: long life,
wealth, tranquillity, love of virtue, and a peaceful
end. The last-named takes the highest rank
amongst these advantages, no doubt, because it
is so difficult to secure it. The age I now am
proves that I have lived a long time; as for my
wealth, I have owned all that is in the four seas.
I am a father, and have one hundred and fifty
sons and grandsons.... I have probably even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
more daughters.... I leave the Empire in peace
... so that the happiness I enjoy may well be
called great.... If no accident befalls me, I shall
die content.</p>

<p>"I have one more reflection to make. Although
I cannot claim that since I have been on the
throne I have changed all evil customs and reformed
the manners of all my people; although
I have not succeeded in securing abundance for
every family and the necessaries of life to every
individual, so that I cannot in these respects be
compared to the wise emperors of the first three
dynasties, I can assert that during my long reign
I have had no other aim than to preserve peace
for the whole Empire, to make my people content,
each one in his own sphere and profession; it is
to this I have! devoted assiduous care with incredible
ardour and ceaseless toil, which toil has
done much to exhaust the strength alike of my
body and of my spirit. Amongst my predecessors
there were some who reigned but a short time, and
historians turn this to account to censure them,
attributing their premature death to inordinate
love of wine and women.... This is quite a
regular rule, and they make a merit of raking up
stories against accomplished princes who were
really the least reprehensible of men."</p>

<p>Kang-Hy then goes on to make an elaborate
justification of his predecessors, claiming that their
days were shortened by hard work and devotion
to duty; he singles out two or three of his own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
ancestors for special praise, and wanders, as most
royal and imperial authors do, into numerous side-issues
before he returns to the subject of his own
life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A NAÃVE EULOGY</div>

<p>"I, Emperor," he goes on to say, "applied
myself to the study of wisdom from infancy, and
have acquired a knowledge of ancient and modern
science." He adds that when in his full vigour,
he could shoot arrows some thirteen cubits long
from bows of huge span; that he knew all about
the handling of weapons, and had often appeared
at the head of his armies in person. He boasts,
moreover, that throughout his whole life he had
never put any one to death without cause; he had
also put down several revolts, and every enterprise
in which he had engaged had been conducted in
the most successful way by his genius alone.</p>

<p>After thus as it were pronouncing his own
funeral oration, he proceeds to appoint his successor
in the following terms:</p>

<p>"Young-t-Ching, my fourth son, is a man of rare
and valuable character. He greatly resembles me,
and I have no doubt he will be capable of bearing
the burden of his great inheritance. I ordain that
after my death he shall ascend the throne and take
possession of the Imperial dignity. In conformity
with custom, mourning shall be worn for me for
twenty-seven days only. Let this edict be published
at Court and in all the provinces, that no
one may be ignorant of its contents."</p>

<p>The author of this naÃ¯ve eulogy of his own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
virtues died in 1722, having caught a chill whilst
hunting a leopard beyond the Great Wall. As
he would himself have wished, his last illness was
short; he would have said that his end was peace,
and that he had achieved the most difficult of the
five things which make up human happiness.</p>

CH'ING DYNASTY, PROBABLY KIEN-LONG.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">FIRST ENGLISH EMBASSY</div>

<p>The reign of Young-t-Ching, who was duly installed
Emperor with all possible pomp after his
father's death, was not marked by any special
events, and but for his persecution of the Christians,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
the new monarch seems to have justified the high
opinion his predecessor had of him. He died in
1735, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Kien-Long,
during whose reign the Chinese Court was
visited for the first time by Englishmen, Lord
Macartney having been sent in 1792 at the head
of a mission to lay the grievances of English
merchants before the Emperor and demand redress.
This mission was of so much importance to the
future relations between the English Government
and the Celestial Empire, that some details are
given here.</p>

<p>The Embassy was received at Tien-tsin with
courtesy, but with no special honour, for in those
days none of the officials had any idea that a
messenger from a foreign court would come to
their country, except to bring tribute and do
homage to the Son of Heaven. On the yachts
and junks which took the party up the Pei-ho
river were displayed flags bearing the legend,
"Ambassadors bearing tribute from the country
of England." In his account of the expedition,
Sir George Staunton, who edited Lord Macartney's
journals, says: "The approach of the embassy
was an event of which the report spread rapidly
... crowds of men assembled on the banks ...
while the females, as shy as they were cautious,
looked through gates or peeped over walls to enjoy
the sight. A few indeed of the ancient dames
almost dipped their feet into the river to get a
nearer peep."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>It was at Zhehol, about fifty miles north of the
Great Wall, where the Emperor had a summer
palace, that he consented to receive the ambassador,
who was lodged, whilst waiting for the final arrangements
to be made, at Yuen-min-Yuen, about seven
miles from the capital. A serious hitch occurred
in the absolute refusal of Lord Macartney to perform
what is known as the ko-too, an act of
homage always exacted from a vassal by his liege
lord, consisting of nine prostrations at his feet.
To have yielded would have been to recognize
Kien-Long as the superior of the King of Great
Britain, and to Lord Macartney's firmness on this
occasion is due all the later success of his fellow-countrymen
in the Celestial Empire. Finding him
resolute, the President of the Board of Rites and
the other great mandarins who had waited upon
him, finally consented to a compromise, and the
English party, escorted by a guard of Tartars,
made their way to Zhehol, where, to quote the
words of the ambassador, he saw "King Solomon
in all his glory," being received by him in the
presence of all the princes of the Imperial family,
the great officers of State, the Mongol chiefs, etc.,
with all courtesy. "The hall of audience," we are
told, "was a magnificent tent in the park, supported
by gilded pillars, at the upper end of which was
placed a throne under a canopy raised several steps
from the ground.... The Emperor was carried
in a palanquin by sixteen bearers, his approach
announced by the sound of gongs and trumpets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
... he was plainly dressed in a robe of brown
silk, with no ornaments but one large pearl in the
front of his black velvet cap."</p>

<p>The ambassador, who merely bent one knee in
presenting his credentials, was very graciously
greeted by the venerable monarch, and when
presents had been exchanged, etc., a sumptuous
meal was served to the accompaniment of a band
of music. The visitors passed a week at Zhehol,
and witnessed the festivities in honour of their
host's birthday; they were then politely informed
that it was time for them to go, and that an answer
would be sent to them at Canton to the letter from
their King. They were escorted to that sea-port
by land and river through the five chief provinces
of China, the journey occupying ten weeks, and
were greatly struck with the high cultivation of the
country and with its teeming population. The
promised answer from the Emperor was duly
received, and though it did not accede to all the
requests made in that of George III., much was
gained by the mission, for the trade with England
was placed on a far better footing than before.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A REMARKABLE VOW</div>

<p>On his accession to the throne, Kien-Long made
the remarkable vow "that should he be permitted
... to complete the sixtieth year of his reign, he
would show his gratitude to Heaven by resigning
the crown to his heir as an acknowledgment that
he had been favoured to the full extent of his
wishes." The year after Lord Macartney's visit
the allotted period was reached, and the Emperor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
abdicated in favour of his youngest son, who took
the name of Kea-King, and was duly accepted
by the Celestials. Kien-Long retained the title of
Supreme Emperor until his death at the age of
eighty-eight, but he meddled no more in affairs
of State, though he continued to aid those who
were in distress, winning the name of the Father
of his people. He was especially good to the
poorer literati, and himself produced several books
of high excellence.</p>

<p>Kea-King was, alas! a very different ruler from
his father, who had chosen him out of all his
children on account of his supposed talent. He
had none of the dignity which had characterized
the other monarchs of the Manchu dynasty, and
chose his friends from amongst the lowest and
most depraved of his subjects, taking them with
him, it is said, even into the sacred precincts of
the Temples when he went to offer sacrifices as the
Son of Heaven. It was during the reign of this
unworthy scion of a noble house that Lord
Amherst was sent to Pekin on a mission similar
to that of Lord Macartney. He was not, however,
able to see the Emperor, and he and his companions
were very rudely treated by the Tartar
nobles. The English, on their return home, gave
a very far from flattering account of the so-called
Celestial court, where they said the whip was
largely in use to keep even the great dignitaries in
order. The Chinese were then, as they still are,
ruled by the whip and the bamboo, for, says a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
writer who knew the country well, "The viceroy
bamboos the mandarins, the mandarins bamboo
their inferior officers, and these ... bamboo the
common people; the husband bamboos the wife, the
father the son, even when the latter is of mature
age."</p>

<p>Before his death Kea-King, who lived to the
age of sixty-one, in spite of his excesses, in his turn
issued a will in the form of an edict, which contains
several interesting passages throwing considerable
light on the physical difficulties the authorities have
to contend with in the Celestial Empire, as well as
on the manners and customs of the people. In it
the dying monarch mourns over the devastations
caused by "China's sorrow," the Yellow River,
and enumerates the measures he had taken to
check its ravages. He pronounced, as was usual,
an eulogy on his own conduct, and appointed his
second son Taou-Kwang his successor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">'THE GLORY OF REASON'</div>

<p>The name of the new ruler signified the Glory of
Reason, and he ascended the throne in 1820. He
justified his father's choice by doing all in his
power to atone for the mischief done by the
weakness and vices of his predecessor, but the
chiefs of the unruly Tartar tribes had so got the
upper hand that they were beyond his control;
one insurrection followed another, and when after
making concession after concession, peace was at
last restored to the distracted country, a far more
formidable enemy had to be contended with from
without. The long series of petty quarrels between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
the English and Celestials on questions of trade
culminated in the war already more than once
referred to, which lasted for many years, and
resulted in the final breaking through of Chinese
isolation, and the throwing open of five ports to
European trade.</p>

<p>It was the beginning of the end; the first
step towards that partition of China which is now
being so rapidly effected. Heart-broken at the
destruction of all his hopes, Taou-Kwang never
held his head up again after the signing of the
Treaty of Nanking in 1842. The death of his
adopted mother soon afterwards, it is said, hastened
his end, and he died in 1851 after a reign of
thirty years, during which he had known no peace
or comfort.</p>

OF TUNG-CHE.</div>
</div>

<p>His fourth son, Yih-Choo, was chosen as his
successor, and he took the name of Hien-Fung,
signifying universal plenty, but the title turned out
a terrible misnomer, for the new Emperor inherited
his father's feeble sensual character, and he had
not long been on the throne before the Tai-Ping
rebellion broke out. The leader, an able man who
had been converted to Christianity, all but succeeded
in turning out the Manchu dynasty and inaugurating
a new one, with himself as Emperor, under
the title of Teen-Wang, or the Heavenly King.
To add to the difficulties of Hien-Fung, the
English declared war against him in 1857, on
account of an outrage on British sailors. The
French took part in the campaign, as the allies of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
the British, and after a struggle lasting three years
Pekin itself was entered. Peace was eventually
made, on terms very greatly to the advantage of
the English, and yet another blow was struck at
Chinese prestige by the Treaty of Pekin, signed
in 1860. The Tai-Ping
rebellion was
crushed with the
aid of Major Gordon,
who afterwards
became so
celebrated as the
Hero of Khartoum,
but the Celestials
lost more
than they gained,
and since then the
occupant of the
throne of the once
powerful Empire
has been a mere
cipher.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE REGENTS AND TUNG-CHE</div>

<p>Hien-Fung died
in 1861, leaving his
enfeebled throne to his infant son, Tung-Che, then
only five years old. The government was carried
on for him by the so-called Regents, two of the late
Emperor's wives, one the legitimate Empress, the
other the secondary consort, who did their best to
consolidate his power, and seem to have ruled
with considerable wisdom and moderation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Rebellion was still, however, rife in the important
province of Yunnan, a Mohammedan prince, named
Suleiman, still defying the Imperial authority.
This leader even sent his son Hassan to England
in 1872, to try and obtain the recognition of his
father by Queen Victoria. Needless to add, he
was not successful, the British Government having
already espoused the cause of the young Emperor.</p>

<p>In 1893, the Regents resigned their delegated
authority into the hands of Tung-Che, now seventeen
years old, but he only reigned two years before
he died of small-pox, leaving no children, although
he is said to have had two legitimate wives and
sixty-nine concubines. His brief term of office
was marked by one special event full of significance
for foreigners: the various ministers accredited
to Pekin, but hitherto not received at the Palace,
succeeded in forcing the young monarch to see
them in the very stronghold of conservatism.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the death of the Emperor Tung-Che, there
was for the first time for three hundred years no
direct heir to the throne of China, and it being
the law of the country that the heir must be
younger than the person he inherits from, the
choice fell upon the infant son of one of Tung-Che's
brothers, the Prince of Chun, seventh son
of Taou-Kwang, who still occupies the throne, if
throne it can be called, when the monarch is
a mere prisoner in the hands of the Dowager
Empress, compelled to amuse himself in his enforced
seclusion as best he can, and spending much
of his time in training pets, such as goats and
monkeys. The ambitious title of Kwang-Sen, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
the "Succession of Glory," was bestowed upon
the little fellow of four years old, who has, alas!
found his reign rather a succession of misfortunes
of every kind than one redounding either to his
own glory or that of his people. Once more the
unfortunate country has had to suffer all the evils
of a long minority, the real power being in the
hands of an unscrupulous woman, who yields the
sceptre of state with a hand of iron, keeping the
"Son of Heaven" in complete subjection. "For
many years," says the astute observer, Archibald
Colquhoun, in his <i>China in Transformation</i>, "the
politics of Pekin have been swayed by a bitter
Palace feud; the young Emperor and his party on
one side, and the Empress Dowager on the other.
Of a passionate nature and an imperious will,
inspired by purely selfish considerations, the late
Regent continues to dominate and even to terrorize
the Emperor, who is of feeble physique, and incapable
of wielding the power which belongs to him."</p>

<p>He is a mere puppet in the hands of those who
ought to obey him, and his name is not associated
with a single act of policy worthy of the ruler
of a great Empire. Li-Hung-Chang, the courtier,
more than once already referred to, is the chief
agent of the Dowager Empress, and to these two
was due the disgraceful abandonment of the war
with Japan&mdash;which the Emperor himself wished to
carry on to the bitter end&mdash;and the signing of the
ignominious treaty in 1895. It is just possible that
should the Empress Dowager die before him&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
she is an old woman now&mdash;the Emperor Kwang-Sen
may yet take the reins of government into his
own hands, but with pretty well every European
nation clamouring for a slice of his dominions,
he will indeed be a wonderful man if he succeeds
in leaving any semblance of power to his successor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EMPEROR'S APARTMENTS</div>

<p>This unfortunate occupant of a doomed throne
has spent most of his life at Pekin in the great
Palace of his ancestors, his apartments being
situated in the centre of the multitudinous buildings,
not far from those set apart for the use of
the real ruler, the Dowager Empress. The space
the Palace occupies is so vast that ministers on
their way to the Council Chamber have more than
half a mile to walk after entering the precincts.
Audience is only given by the Emperor at the
early hours, four, five, or six in the morning, and
certain high functionaries have the privilege accorded
them of being carried to the reception-hall
in sedan-chairs. Many an important personage,
rejoicing in all manner of high-sounding titles, has
however been compelled to remain waiting all
night in gala costume in some ante-room, for the
early morning interview, and foreigners complain
bitterly of the discomforts they still have to endure
before they are allowed to come face to face either
with the real or the nominal head of the State.</p>

<p>A friend of mine, connected with the French
Embassy, told me that on one of the very rare
occasions when he and some of his colleagues
succeeded in obtaining an interview with the Son
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
of Heaven, the time fixed for the audience was
at four o'clock a.m. He was conducted by a
chamberlain to a room in which a few candles
were burning on a table covered with a yellow
cloth. On the other side of this table opposite to
him was the Emperor, with a screen of a delicate
jonquil-yellow colour on either side. Behind one
of these screens knelt Prince Kung, and behind the
other the Empress.</p>

<p>Obeying a sign from the chamberlain, the
visitors saluted the Emperor, but without performing
the ko-too, from which Lord Macartney
saved all foreigners by his firm attitude in 1793,
and my friend, as he rose up after his respectful
obeisance, could not resist just raising his eyes to
have a good look at the Son of Heaven, who was
at that moment yawning enough to dislocate his
jaws. For this presumption the <i>attachÃ©</i> was immediately
rebuked by the chamberlain, who ordered
him to keep his eyes fixed on the ground until the
end of the interview.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EMPEROR'S BED</div>

<p>The Emperor's apartments consist of seven
spacious rooms, in each of which is a k'ang or
divan, such as is in use everywhere in the north
of China, covered with red felt of native manufacture,
and provided with cushions adorned with
gold embroidery, representing the symbolic dragon
and ph&#339;nix. On the floors of the royal domain
are beautiful European carpets of various kinds,
and numerous tables, what-nots, etc., are crowded
with objects of art, such as porcelain and pottery,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
mostly produced in China, though of late years
some foreign products have figured amongst them.</p>

<p>The Son of Heaven sleeps in a big bed made
at Ningpo, richly decorated with gold and ivory,
the very same as that used by his illustrious
ancestor Kang-Hy. He is treated by the eight
eunuchs in attendance on his person with as much
reverence as was the great founder of the now
weakened dynasty, and as are the Lamas in the
convents on the lofty plateaux of Thibet and
Mongolia, where the modified form of Buddhism
known as Lamaism is practised.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">FIG. 56.&mdash;A CHINESE SEDAN-CHAIR AND BEARERS.</div>
</div>

<p>The person of the Emperor is held so sacred
that neither iron nor steel is ever allowed to touch
him, which of course makes it impossible for him
to receive surgical aid should he be suffering from
any of the diseases requiring the use of the knife.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Fortunately he was vaccinated when an infant in
the cradle, before those in charge of him had any
suspicion of the great destiny in store for him.
The story goes that a doctor who proposed to
save the life of a Chinese Emperor by bleeding
him, nearly lost his own head as a punishment.
The same superstition prevails in Corea, where one
of the kings died in the eighteenth century, when
he might have been saved if he, or rather those
about him, could have been induced to allow a
lancet to be used on his sacred person.</p>

<p>The young Emperor was declared of age in 1889,
and he was at once informed that the foreign
ministers would be glad to be allowed to pay their
respects to him on this auspicious occasion. To
their great surprise consent to their reception was
given not very long afterwards, that consent being
published in the <i>Pekin Gazette</i> in the following
year in terms most flattering to all concerned.
After the usual preamble the Emperor was made
to say:</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN IMPORTANT INTERVIEW</div>

<p>"The ministers of the various powers residing
in Pekin have abundantly shown their loyal desire
to maintain peaceful relations and international
friendship. This I cordially recognize, and I rejoice
in it.... It is also hereby decreed that a
day be fixed every year for an audience; ... on
the next day the foreign ministers are to be
received at a banquet at the Foreign Office. The
same is to be done every year in the first month,
and the rule will be the same on each occasion..."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
The remainder of the proclamation was couched
in equally courteous terms, presenting a very
marked contrast to the grudging, indeed almost
insolent, assent given by previous Emperors to
any request for an audience by the representatives
of the European powers. When the interview
took place, moreover, the various ministers were
admitted to the presence of their host one by one,
instead of all together as on previous occasions,
whilst the <i>attachÃ©s</i>, etc., were received collectively
later. The Emperor was seated on a raised
platform at the end of the vast reception-hall,
with Prince Ching, President of the Foreign
Board, kneeling on one side. As each minister
came up to the platform making three bows on
the way, he was introduced by the Prince, who
took from him the letters of credence and placed
them on a table near the Son of Heaven, who,
after bowing an acknowledgment, made a long
speech to the Prince, who listened to it on his
knees. The reply completed, he rose, and with
uplifted arms went down into the body of the
hall, where he repeated to the foreign interpreter
the following speech:</p>

<p>"We desire to convey to all the ministers, <i>chargÃ©s
d'affaires</i>, and secretaries, who have presented congratulations
to us, that we truly appreciate, and
are very pleased with all their kind expressions,
and we sincerely wish that their respective sovereigns
may this year have all things according to
their hearts' desire, and that their happiness and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
prosperity may increase. We also hope that you
ministers will stay long in China in the full enjoyment
of health, and that friendly relations between
China and foreign countries will never cease."</p>

<p>Surely nothing could be more courteous and
conciliatory than the behaviour of the young
Emperor on this important occasion, and but for
the terrible war with Japan, which so soon afterwards
shook his throne to its foundations, he
might perhaps have won a real alliance with some
Western power, which would have saved him from
the partition of his Empire, from which there is
now no hope of escape.</p>

<p>On the coming of age of the Son of Heaven, his
mother, the Princess of Chun, was raised to the
rank of Empress, but his father, the Prince, received
no accession of dignity. Both parents, when admitted
to the presence of their august son, kneel
to him and treat him as a being altogether superior
to themselves. Still young, Kwang-Sen is fond of
riding, shooting with the bow-and-arrow, and skating.
His day is rigidly portioned out, and he has
little real liberty. When he was a child his teachers
approached him on their knees, and were only
allowed to sit in his presence when he gave them
permission. He had to work at the Chinese and
Manchu languages for an hour and a half every
day, and is really extremely well-educated, though,
fortunately for foreigners, he is anything but fond
of the mandarins or literati, who would gladly
poison his mind against everything European. At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
regular intervals he goes to do homage at the
tombs of his ancestors, as do all of high or low
degree in China, and on these solemn occasions
he is accompanied by the Empresses and a suite
of no less than thirty thousand persons, including
princes, nobles, mandarins, apparitors, lictors,
banner-bearers, porters, etc. Long before dawn
on the day of the ceremony the main road is
strewn with fine sand, and decorated with white
and blue velvet flags, whilst at regular intervals
tables are set up covered with yellow drapery, and
bearing the inscription, <i>Ya Tao</i>, signifying the
Imperial road, words full of terrible significance to
the Chinese, for they mean that all on pain of death
should keep out of the way of the Son of Heaven.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STRINGENT MEASURES OF PRECAUTION</div>

<p>The most stringent measures are taken even in
the capital to protect the sovereign from the gaze
of the profane. Not only are all the inhabitants
compelled to close the doors of their houses when
he is about to pass, but no one is allowed to climb
on the walls of the town, lest from them they
should catch even a glimpse of the Imperial procession.
Nor is it only reverence for the sacred
person which leads to all these precautions: there
is the danger that some evil-minded person might
attempt to take the life of the Emperor by firing
at him from a distance with one of those awful
engines of destruction, the range of which even
now seems so extraordinary to the Celestials, in
spite of their recent experiences in the war with
the Japanese. The Chinese police forbid even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
European women to show themselves on the day of
the procession, lest the sovereign should see them,
for the myrmidons of the law, accustomed to the
strict seclusion of the female sex in their native land,
believe that those who enjoy a liberty such as that
of the wives and daughters of the diplomatists, to
be capable of any
crime even against
the venerated Son
of Heaven.</p>

(<i>Univers Pittoresque.</i>)</div>
</div>

<p>A wife was of
course chosen for
Kwang-Sen as soon
as he attained his
majority, and the
lady selected for the
difficult position of
Empress was the
daughter of an official
of the province
of Che-kiang, who
was, it is said, as
good and as well
educated as she was beautiful. Truly it must have
been an immense change in her life to be raised
from her humble position as the child of a mere
nobody, to be placed on the throne of the most
populous Empire of the world, and the way in
which she has fulfilled her high destiny is very
differently judged by the few who really know
anything of Palace life in China. Her influence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
has not of course been as paramount as it would
have been in a country where monogamy was
practised. Very soon after she became a bride,
various supplementary beauties were chosen to
fill the royal harem, and the so-called lotus flowers,
tea-blossoms, etc., were all equally irreproachable
in manners and morals from the Chinese point of
view. The number of left-handed marriages permitted
in China is illimitable, and where there is
money enough to support them, a man often has
as many as three hundred secondary wives.</p>

<p>As a matter of course there is none of the fierce
jealousy in the Celestial Empire such as is aroused
on the mere suspicion of a rival in the virtuous
bosom of a European wife. Other countries, other
manners; and in China wives and concubines live
peacefully enough under one roof, with no more
friction than is seen amongst the hens in a poultry-yard.
Time alone can show what will be the
eventual outcome of the life now being lived in
the Imperial Palace of Pekin, for time alone can
sift the truth from the many conflicting rumours
which reach the outer world. One thing alone is
certain, China will be the battle-ground of the
future, and the yellow peril, about which so much has
been prophesied, will assume many an unexpected
form before the century just about to begin in its
turn nears its close.</p>

<h2><a name="CONCLUSION" id="CONCLUSION"></a>CONCLUSION</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> every month brings some change in the
political position in China, and the daily press is
full of more or less contradictory rumours as to
what is going on at Pekin, it is impossible to
come to any real decision on the many vexed
questions under discussion. One great fact, however,
emerges distinctly from out of the chaos of
conflicting data, and that is, that it will be Russia,
with her wonderful faculty for working steadily
onwards towards a definite aim, who will secure
the lion's share in the spoliation of the Celestials,
whilst her Trans-Siberian railway, which already
pays its way, creating trade wherever it passes, and
in another four years will connect St. Petersburg
with Port Arthur, will be one of the most important
factors in changing the course of the commerce of
the world.</p>

<p>Shut in as she is on the East by the English
in Burmah and the French in Cochin-China,
threatened on the West by the Germans and the
Japanese, and dominated on the north by Russia,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
the Celestial Empire finds herself compelled to
awake from her long stupor, and to arouse herself to
action of some kind. With no real army, no longer
an efficient fleet, however, what can she do? She
can only choose what seems to her the least of
the evils hemming her in on every side, and elect
from among the many competitors for the post,
the protector best able to save her not only from
her outside enemies, but from herself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IMPORTANCE OF RUSSIA</div>

<p>As has been very aptly said, Russia is of all the
Western Powers the most imbued with Oriental
ideas, and she combines, with the energy and
ambition of a first-rate power of the future, a
sympathy with the Celestials altogether wanting
to France, Germany, or Great Britain. There
is, in fact, an actual affinity of race between the
Chinese and the inhabitants of the northern steppes,
and there is therefore far more hope of real
amalgamation between them than there can be
in any other case. The English, the French, the
Germans, the Italians, if they win the concessions
they are now in their turn clamouring for, will
always be aliens in the districts they acquire, and
there will never, to use a homely but expressive
phrase, be any love lost between them and the
natives.</p>

<p>Li-Hung-Chang, one of the most enlightened
statesmen who have ever arisen in China, came
to Europe in 1896 with a view to ascertaining by
personal observation, which of the western nations
would be likely to be the best friend for his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
distracted country, in the enfeebled condition to
which the war with Japan had reduced her. He
saw quickly enough that it would not be England,
nor Germany, nor France, but that it would be
Russia. It was therefore with Russia that a treaty
was eventually made, and ratified in 1897; this
treaty, in addition to other privileges, giving to the
great northern power. Port Arthur, with the right
of making it a coaling station, and in case of
war of concentrating troops in its harbour. "The
Russians and the Chinese," said Mitchie, writing
more than thirty years ago, "are peculiarly suited
to each other ... the Russians meet the Chinese
as Greek meets Greek ... they understand each
other's character thoroughly, because they are so
closely alike." Recent events have proved how
true was the insight of this astute observer, and it
is evident that whilst the other Powers will have
to content themselves with their various spheres
of influence, Russia alone will obtain real political
control of the Celestial Empire as a whole. There
remains now no hope that the disintegrating forces
at work in the once powerful nation will be
arrested from within, in spite of the fact that again
and again China has risen in the past from
apparent dissolution into a greater nation than
before, absorbing her conquerors and converting
them into patriots, ready to dare all for their
adopted country. The saving force must now come
from without, and when once more there is a strong
hand directed by a strong brain at the head of
affairs, the resources of the unhappy land will be
found to be practically inexhaustible. With a prolific
soil, vast mineral wealth, and a teachable
population, there is indeed no limit to what China,
which has been called the India of the future, may
become.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>In the imminent partition of China into spheres
of influence, should that partition finally supersede
the more generous policy of the opening of the
whole country on equal terms to the trade of all
the European nations, the Yang-tse basin, with
its populous towns of Nanking, Hankow, Fuchan,
and others, will be the field of action of Great
Britain; whilst Shantung, a rich sea-bound province,
will be that of Germany; and the French, who
already occupy Tonking on the south, will obtain
concessions in the neighbouring districts. On
every side railways are now being projected, and
the probability is that ere the century just about
to open has run half its course, the whole of
China will be intersected by them.</p>

<p>In the Blue Book on Chinese affairs, issued on
the 14th March of the current year (1899), the
following significant statistics of the railway concessions
granted to foreigners in the Celestial
Empire are given, showing that Great Britain is
more than equal to Russia in the actual amount
of mileage secured, whilst Germany, France, Belgium,
and America have among them less than
Great Britain alone:</p>

<p>More important still, as breaking up finally the
isolation on which China has prided herself for
so many centuries, is the fact that already pretty
well all the important towns of the vast Empire
are connected by telegraph with each other, and
with the outside world. The search-light of publicity
is in fact turned full upon the land once so
fraught with mystery, and before long there will
be no hidden thing connected with either court
or country which will not be revealed to the
inquisitive gaze of all the world.</p>

author. We all know what shrewdness of observation, what power of graphic description,
what natural resources of drollery, and what a happy method of hitting off the

incident to life in the backwoods, and, above all, the peculiarities of American society, are
variously, powerfully, and for the most part amusingly exemplified."&mdash;<i>John Bull</i>.</p>

<p class="caption4nb">By <span class="smcap">Beatrice Whitby</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"We have no hesitation in declaring that 'The Awakening of Mary Fenwick' is the
best novel of its kind that we have seen for some years. It is apparently a first effort,
and, as such, is really remarkable. The story is extremely simple. Mary Mauser marries
her husband for external, and perhaps rather inadequate, reasons, and then discovers
that he married her because she was an heiress. She feels the indignity acutely, and
does not scruple to tell him her opinion&mdash;her very candid opinion&mdash;of his behaviour. That
is the effect of the first few chapters, and the rest of Miss Whitby's book is devoted to
relating how this divided couple hated, quarrelled, and finally fell in love with one another.
Mary Fenwick and her husband live and move and make us believe in them in a way
which few but the great masters of fiction have been able to compass."&mdash;<i>AthenÃ¦um</i>.</p></div>

<p>"This story is distinguished by its pure and elegant English, and the refinement of its
style and thought. It is a lively account, with many touches of humour, of Art study in
Florence, and the story weaved into it exhibits a high ideal of life ... The lively, pleasant,
and refined tone of the narrative and dialogue will recommend the story to all
cultivated renders."&mdash;<i>Spectator</i>.</p>

<p>"Beatrice Hamlyn is an emancipated young woman of the most pleasing type, and her
friend Evelyn is hardly less amiable. But the cleverness of Miss Hart's story lies in the
simple yet effective portrait of the Italian character. The elder Vivaldi is presented to us
in a way that shows both knowledge and sympathy. There are pleasing touches of
humour, too, in the minor personages."&mdash;<i>Saturday Review</i>.</p></div>

touches, and the question of short-sighted though loving foolishness is kept in the background.

fair and just, and so good qualities of both parties are done justice to. Not that
politics as such do more than form a background for the sweet figure of Mistress Beatrice,

one has looked forward to her succeeding books with interest. The present one is a
pleasant book, well-written, well-conceived. A book that is written in good sensible

<p>"'Ninette' is something more than a novel; it is a careful and elaborate study of life

'The Wooing O't.' will consider it the most satisfactory of them all, as a piece of literary
work, as well as the most interesting as a story. Starting from a point so common as the
suppression of a will, the reader before long finds himself following her into the least

natural and equally unlooked-for means. The portraiture is invariably adequate, and the

His portrait of Mahme Nousie is faithful as well as touching. Like all her race
she is a being of one idea, and that idea is her child. To keep her away from the island,
to have her brought up as a lady, it is for this that Nousie has opened a cabaret for the
negroes and has sat at the receipt of custom herself. Of course she never once thinks of
the shock that the girl must undergo when she is plunged suddenly into such a position,
she never thinks about anything but the fact that she is to have her child again. Her
gradual awakening, and the struggles of both mother and daughter to hide their pain, are
finely told. So is the story of how they both remained 'faithful unto death.' History has
a power to charm which is often lacking in tales of higher pretensions."&mdash;<i>Saturday Review</i>.</p></div>

<p>"'The Idea of March' is a capital book. The plot does not depend for its interest upon
anything more fantastic than an old gentleman's belief that a family curse will take effect
unless his son marries by a given date. The complications which arise from this son's
being really in love with a girl whom he believes to have treated his friend, Captain Disney,
vary badly, and getting engaged to another girl, who transfers her affections to the
same Captain Disney, are skilfully worked out, while the dialogue is, in parts, extremely
bright, and the description of the founding of the Norchester branch of the Women's
Sanitary League really funny."&mdash;<i>Literary World</i>.</p>

<p>"'The Idea of March,' in spite of its classical name, is a story of the present time, and

spirited girl against a match which has been arranged for her without her knowledge or
consent; her resentment at being treated, not as a woman with, a heart and will, but as
'part of the property'; and her final discovery, which is led up to with real dramatic skill,
that the thing against which her whole nature had risen in revolt has become the one
desire of her heart. The mutual relations each to each of the impetuous Hedge, her self-willed,
stubborn grandfather, who has arranged the match, and her lover Jocelyn, with
his loyal, devoted, sweetly-balanced nature, are portrayed with fine truth of insight; but
perhaps the author's greatest triumph is the portrait of Mrs. Lindsay, who, with the
knowledge of the terrible skeleton in the cupboard of her apparently happy home, wears
so bravely the mask of light gaiety as to deceive everybody but the one man who knows
her secret. It is refreshing to read a novel in which there is not a trace of slipshod work."</p></div>

The difficulties of the leading situation&mdash;a daughter obliged to pass from one parent to

work; to win success from that portion of the public that does not look for the brilliant
achievements of genius, but can recognise meritorious work. The tale is an agreeable

and understanding. The author has a steady mastery over the story she wishes
to tell, and she tells it clearly and eloquently, without hesitation and without prolixity.
The book has this merit&mdash;the first merit of a novel&mdash;that the reader is interested in the
people rather than the plot, and that he watches the development of character rather
than that of event."&mdash;<i>Literary World</i>.</p></div>

<p>"Sir Anthony introduces two mysterious children, Henry and Elfrida, into his house, and
compels his wife, whom he dislikes, to protect and virtually adopt them. In due course
he tells these children, in his own vigorous Anglo-Saxon, 'You two are my eldest son
and daughter, lawfully begotten of my wife, once Mary Derrick, and known afterwards
as Mary Paston. You will be Sir Henry Kesterton when I die, and Elfrida is heiress
to her grandmother's money and jewels.' Lady Kesterton overheard this terrible
statement. He repeats it in a still more offensive form. Thereupon she gives him an
overdose of chloral and fights desperately, and with temporary success, for what she
regards as the rights of her children, but especially of her son Gerard. Failure overtakes
her, and Elfrida, though not poor Henry, comes by her own. The plot is good and
thoroughly sustained from first to last."&mdash;<i>Academy</i>.</p></div>

finds that to catch a robber of Thunderbolt's temperament and ability requires local
knowledge as well as other gifts undreamt-of by the Hussar officer. Thunderbolt goes
to races under the Major's nose, dances in the houses of his friends, robs Her Majesty's

that characterised his prototype. His tragical end is told with spirit, while the book
has excellent descriptions of Australian life, both in town and country."&mdash;<i>Morning Post</i>.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"M. E. Le Clerc devotes herself to historic fiction, and her success is sufficient to justify
her in the occasional production of stories like 'Mistress Beatrice Cope' and 'Robert Carroll.'
Beatrice Cope was a Jacobite's daughter, so far as memory serves, and Robert Carroll
was the son of a Jacobite baronet, who played and lost his stake at Preston, fighting for the
Old Pretender. Of course the hero loved a maiden whose father was a loyal servant of
King George, and, almost equally of course, one of this maiden's brothers was a Jacobite.
A second brother, by the way, appears as a lad of sixteen in the spring of 1714, and as a
wounded colonel of cavalry on the morrow of the fight at Preston, less than two years
later&mdash;rapid promotion even for those days, though certainly not impossible. The author
has taken pains to be accurate in her references to the events of the time, and her blend
of fact and fiction is romantic enough."&mdash;<i>AthenÃ¦um</i>.</p></div>

and, as such, is really remarkable. The story is extremely simple. Mary Mauser marries
her husband for external, and perhaps rather inadequate, reasons, and then discovers
that he married her because she was an heiress. She feels the indignity acutely, and
does not scruple to tell him her opinion&mdash;her very candid opinion&mdash;of his behaviour. That
is the effect of the first few chapters, and the rest of Miss Whitby's book is devoted to
relating how this divided couple hated, quarrelled, and finally fell in love with one another.

'part of the property;' and her final discovery, which is led up to with real dramatic skill,
that the thing against which her whole nature had risen in revolt has become the one
desire of her heart. The author's greatest triumph is the portrait of Mrs. Lindsay, who,

touches, and the question of short-sighted though loving foolishness is kept in the background.
The volume is written in a pleasant informal manner, and contains many tender
generous thoughts, and not a few practical ones. It is a book that will be read with interest,

<p>"This is a very admirable work. The reader is from the first carried away by the
gallant unconventionality of its author. 'Donovan' is a very excellent novel; but it is
something more and better. It should do as much good as the best sermon ever written
or delivered extempore. The story is told with a grand simplicity, an unconscious poetry
of eloquence which stirs the very depths of the heart. One of the main excellencies of
this novel is the delicacy of touch with which the author shows her most delightful characters

her picture is always alive with vividness and grace."&mdash;<i>AthenÃ¦um</i>.</p></div>

<p>"We are glad to welcome Miss Lyall back after her long abstraction from the fields of
prosperous, popular authorship which she had tilled so successfully. She again affronts
her public with a very serious work of fiction indeed, and succeeds very well in that
thorny path of the historical novel in which so many have failed before her. That 'glory
of warrior, glory of orator, glory of song,' John Hampden, lives again, to a certain extent,
in that dim half light of posthumous research and loving and enthusiastic imagination
which is all the novelist can do for these great figures of the past, resurrected to make the
plot of a modern novel."&mdash;<i>Black and White</i>.</p></div>
